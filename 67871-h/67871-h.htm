<p class="blockquot no-indent">Thomas Jefferson, while “overwhelmed with other business,”
cut such passages from the Evangelists as he believed would
best present the ethical teachings of Jesus, and “arranged
them on the pages of a blank book in a certain order of time or
subject.” This book he called “The Philosophy of Jesus of
Nazareth.”</p>

<p class="blockquot">For many years the manuscript of this wonderful book
has lain in the archives of the State Department at Washington,
and public clamor for its publication at last became so
great that Congress recently ordered it issued as a public
document—but in very limited number.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Before the original was turned over to the State Department,
an accurate copy of it was made while in the possession
of Col. Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Mr. Jefferson’s

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY THOMAS E. WATSON</p>

<h3><i>In Russia</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">“A TALE of Two Cities,”
written by the great novelist,
Charles Dickens, contains
a vivid picture, which shows
the relation existing between a nobleman
of the Old Order in France and
one of the common people.</p>

<p>In that day the streets were narrow.
Sidewalks did not separate
the space used by those who went
on foot from that used by those
who went in vehicles. From the
houses on the one side to the houses
on the other, travel was free to
all: those on the ground were ever
in danger from those who were in
vehicles.</p>

<p>Dickens describes the progress of
the carriage of one of the French
aristocrats, driven at headlong speed
along these narrow streets. It whirled
around the corners with a wild rattle
and clatter, and with an utter lack of
consideration for pedestrians. Women
and children scattered, screaming,
to get out of its way, and men
clutched at one another to escape the
danger.</p>

<p>At last, whirling round a corner, by
a fountain, one of the wheels of this
furiously driven carriage strikes a
little child and kills it. Amid the
loud cries of those who behold the
sickening spectacle the horses rear
and plunge and the carriage comes to
a standstill. The nobleman looks out
and calmly inquires what has gone
wrong. He is told that a child has
been run over.</p>

<p>A man is bending over the lifeless
form, screaming with grief.</p>

<p>“Why does he make that abominable
noise?” asks the nobleman.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Monsieur le Marquis,
it was his child,” explains one of the
crowd humbly.</p>

<p>“Killed!” screams the father, lifting
and extending his arms. “Dead!” he
cries.</p>

<p>The Marquis runs his eye over all
the rabble, as though they were so
many rats come out of their holes.
He draws out his purse.</p>

<p>“I do not see why it is that you
people won’t take care of yourselves
and children? One or the other of
you are always in the way. <span class="smcap">How do
I know that you have not injured
one of my horses?</span>”</p>

<p>With this he throws a gold coin on
the ground beside the father of the
child.</p>

<p>The crazed parent continues to
scream: “Dead! Dead!”</p>

<p>As the Marquis is driving away, the
gold coin which he had thrown to the
ground is flung back into the carriage,
and falls rattling at his feet.</p>

<p>“Hold!” says the Marquis. “Hold
the horses! Who threw that coin?”</p>

<p>The crowd makes no answer. No
blouse-clad man dare look him in the
eye.</p>

<p>“You dogs!” says the Marquis
smoothly; “I would ride over any of
you very willingly and exterminate
you from the earth. If I knew who it
was that threw that coin I would have
the brigand crushed under the wheels.”</p>

<p>So cowed were they, so long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
hard had been their experience of
what such a man could do to them,
that not a voice or a hand or an eye
was raised.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of the
French before the great Revolution of
1789; and while the picture is drawn
by a novelist, it is the picture of a
novelist who painted human life and
human conditions as they were never
painted before. His pictures were
photographs.</p>

<p>In another book, not a novel but a
history, (the title and the author of
which shall not be mentioned here),
there is another description of human
relations under the <i>Ancien Régime</i>,
and that description claims to be
literally true. I quote the author’s
own words:</p>

<p>“Was it not in this same year, 1788,
that the Duke of Béthune’s carriage,
dashing through the narrow streets,
as was the aristocratic custom, ran
over a little girl in the rue de la Ferronnerie
and killed her?</p>

<p>“Did not the mother see it all? Did
not she rush wildly to the scene,
snatch up the poor crushed form, gaze
distractedly into the eyes for light <i>and
see none</i>, lay her cheek to that of the
child to feel the warmth of life <i>and feel
none</i>?</p>

<p>“Still was the little heart, gone the
breath, blanched the cheeks, frozen
the tiny hands.</p>

<p>“What sound does the ear ever hear
like that of the voice that was heard
of old in Ramah?</p>

<p>“Shriek after shriek split the air,
piercing every heart in the crowd that
gathered as the frantic mother, holding
her dead child in her arms, gave
voice to her grief.</p>

<p>“<i>And the Duke, what said he?</i> ‘<span class="smcap">Let
the woman come to my house, and
she shall be paid for her loss.</span>’</p>

<p>“He had not even left the carriage;
<i>he had not spoken a word of sympathy
or regret</i>.</p>

<p>“In his view of the case he had done
some damage to this woman, and,
being a man of honor, he was ready to
settle the bill.</p>

<p>“That was all. ‘Drive on,
coachman!’—and never a thought more did
the Duke waste on the mother or
child. <i>They were not of his world, but
of another and a lower.</i>”</p>

<p>This was more than one hundred
years ago. Ever since that time we
have supposed that the human race
has been advancing onward and upward
toward a higher and a better
civilization.</p>

<p>The philosopher has reflected and
advised. The statesman has studied
and planned. The reformer has made
his battle-axe ring at the door of every
abuse.</p>

<p>Learning has spoken from all our
schools. Religion has preached from
all our temples; and yet in one of the
nations of Europe, where the king and
the priest have had absolute control
of the minds and the bodies of the
people for hundreds of years, the point
of view of the aristocrat is precisely
the same that it was in France in the
year 1788. And the man of the common
people submits humbly in 1905
just as he did in 1788.</p>

<p>In Russia no man’s conscience is his
own; it belongs to the Church. In
Russia no man’s action is free; he belongs
to the State. The Czar rules by
“<i>Divine Right</i>.” He is the earthly
representative of <i>the Most High God</i>;
the common people of the land are
mere dirt under his feet, being of a
different world and a lower.</p>

<p>A few Sundays ago his people, in
the belief that his heart—the heart of
their “Little Father”—was accessible
to pity and to the plea for justice,
were coming in peaceful procession,
accompanied by their wives and their
children, to kneel at his feet, lift up
their supplicating hands, and, with
their own tongues, reach his ear with
the true story of their grievances.</p>

<p>Their Little Father refused to see
them or hear them.</p>

<p>Their Little Father threw a glittering
line of steel between himself and
his “children.” The Little Father
ordered, “<i>Fire!</i>” and his children fell
before the storm of lead.</p>

<p>They were shot down like dogs;
women and children were sabered or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
crushed under the iron-shod feet of
horses; they were scourged back to
their hovels, their cellars, their sweltering
dens.</p>

<p>And the hundreds of dead bodies
which littered the streets were thrown
into the river like so much carrion.</p>

<p>A few days afterward it was considered
good politics by the Grand
Dukes who control this contemptible
little Czar to grant a hearing to a
deputation representing these same
laborers.</p>

<p>The whole world had been aroused
to anger and indignation at the manner
in which the Cossacks had massacred
the people.</p>

<p>Public sentiment had made itself
felt even in the inner circles of the
heartless oligarchy which controls the
Russian Empire.</p>

<p>Therefore the Czar was told to receive
the deputation, and he did so.
The deputation bowed down to the
earth before the Czar, who said:
“<i>Good day, my children.</i> I have summoned
you to hear my words, and to
communicate them to your companions.
The recent unfortunate
events were <i>the inevitable results of
your own lawless actions</i>. Those who
induced you to address this petition
to me desire to see you revolt against
me and my government.” After a
few more words of the same complacent
character, this representative of
God on earth said to the delegation:</p>

<p>“I am convinced of <i>the innocence of
the workingmen</i>, and believe that <i>they</i>
are well disposed toward me. <span class="smcap">I will
pardon those transgressors. Return
again to your work. May
God assist you.</span>”</p>

<p>The history of the world has so
many revolting passages that I cannot
say that this Russian episode surpasses
others, but when the head of a
great Christian government tunes his
tongue to the formula of Divine Right
which was current during the Dark
Ages, and gives us a dash of medievalism,
to be reported by a special correspondent
in the daily newspapers,
there is something so anomalous about
the situation that it makes a peculiar
impression of its own.</p>

<p>At least 2,000 of this emperor’s
“children” had been butchered in
cold blood for the high crime of wishing
to present a petition to him for
shorter hours of labor and a more
liberal recognition of their status as
human beings.</p>

<p>“May God assist you,” says the
Czar—leaving it to the benighted
minds of these untutored workmen to
find out how it is that God is going to
assist them, when the representative
of God on earth shoots them down by
the thousand, tramples them beneath
the hoofs of Cossack horses, slashes
them with Cossack sabers, pierces
them with Cossack lances, lashes them
with Cossack scourges, and sends
them bleeding and howling back to
their hopeless homes and miserable
lives, for no offense other than the
wish to kneel at his feet and pray for
better treatment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“<span class="smcap">I forgive you!</span>” says the Czar.</p>

<p><i>Forgives them for what?</i></p>

<p>For being denied the right to petition
the throne, for being driven back
into serfdom, for being hacked and
slashed and trampled and bullet-riddled
by the hireling savages of a
barbarian government!</p>

<p>“<i>As the Great Father above forgives,
so I, your Little Father, forgives.</i>”</p>

<p>Amen. Let the whimpering wretch
who nurses a saber-slashed head recover
in peace. <i>He is pardoned for
having been Cossacked.</i></p>

<p>Let the father who drags his lifeless
daughter from under the hoofs of the
warhorse go weep over her in comfort—he
and she are <i>forgiven for having
dared to hope for mercy from the Czar</i>.</p>

<p>And the nameless dead who went
forth that Sabbath morning, following
the heroic priest whose baton was the
Cross of Christ—went forth in the
glow of lofty purpose and pathetic
hope, and whose bodies are now feeding
the fishes of the Neva—let them
also rest in peace—<i>their Little Father
has forgiven them</i>.</p>

<p>“How do I know that you have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
injured my horses?” asked Dickens’s
Marquis, while the frantic peasant was
lamenting his crushed child.</p>

<p>“Let the woman come to my house;
she shall be paid. Drive on, coachman,”
said the Duke of Béthune.</p>

<p>“Served you right!” says the Czar.</p>

<p>“Served you right!” say the Grand
Dukes, speaking through the individual
called Vladimir.</p>

<p>“You should not have quit work.
You should not have asked a hearing.
You got crushed by my troops. I
forgive you for it. Go back to your
work. Be content with your lot.
May God assist you.”</p>

<p>Thus the voice of class-rule speaks
in Russia today as it spoke in France
on the eve of the Revolution, and as
it always has spoken in every part of
the world <i>since man learned the trick of
enslaving his brother</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As everybody knows, the real governors
of the vast empire of Russia
are the Grand Dukes. The Czar is a
mere puppet in their hands. When he
is obedient they control him. When
he is disobedient they murder him.
Thus they killed Paul, the father
of Alexander the First, because he
favored an alliance with Napoleon
Bonaparte, while the Grand Dukes
favored an alliance with Great Britain.
They would “remove” the present
emperor if he were to pit his will
against theirs.</p>

<p>The spokesman of the present cabal
of Grand Dukes is Vladimir, as perfect
a type of the cruel, obstinate,
narrow-minded aristocrat as Europe
ever saw in its worst days.</p>

<p>Speaking to Michael Davitt, the
Irish member of the British Parliament,
this Grand Duke declared that
the reason why representation could
not be given to the common people of
Russia was that <i>they were not fit to
exercise it</i>.</p>

<p>He regarded and intended this to be
an indictment against the common
people. On the contrary, it is a tremendous
indictment against the government.</p>

<p>The Russian people, as distinguished
from the Russian aristocracy, have
been completely under the control of
the laws and the administration which
the ruling class saw fit to establish.
The altar and the throne have supported
each other. Church and State
have been firm and fast allies. Ever
since the days of Peter the Great the
minds and the consciences of the
common people of Russia have been
absolutely dominated by the ruling
class.</p>

<p>The shepherds have had full control
of the flock. The guardians have had
no interference with the education of
their wards.</p>

<p>If after so many hundreds of years
the mass of the Russian people are so
steeped in ignorance and superstition
that they are unfit to exercise the
common rights of manhood, <i>that fact</i>,
if it be fact, <i>damns the Russian aristocracy
with the deep guilt of having debased
the nation committed to its care
and guidance</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No substantial reform has ever been
conceded within a state governed by
king or aristocracy until the blood of
sacrifice has first been shed.</p>

<p>Spain would grant no concessions to
those who claimed freedom of conscience
in the Netherlands, until years
of warfare had drenched the soil of
Holland with the blood of heroes, who
fought and died for those principles
which we carelessly and unappreciatively
enjoy today.</p>

<p>France would loosen none of the
chains which galled the peasant, until
that peasant rose in his desperation
and paid with his life for the liberty
his descendants inherit. The king
was deaf to all prayers.</p>

<p>The aristocracy drove from power
with insults and persecution every
enlightened minister who proposed to
better the condition of the common
people by conceding moderate reforms.
It was only when the desperation
of despair roused the people
to a furious attack upon time-honored
abuses and vested wrongs of every
conceivable kind, that “<i>privilege</i>”
would harken to reason, and Right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
could find a place on the statute-book.</p>

<p>In England the story has been the
same. In the long procession of the
ages in which the common people have
wrung, one by one, from the grip of
aristocracy those liberties upon which
we now pride ourselves, the price of
blood has been always demanded, and
invariably paid. Never has king or
aristocrat conceded a single demand
of the reformers until those reformers
had either won it in battle or had
made such a demonstration as <i>struck
fear into the hearts of the ruling class</i>.</p>

<p>In Russia precisely the same state
of affairs exists, and if ever liberal institutions
are to take the place of
grand ducal tyranny and class-rule in
that empire the soil will once more
drink the blood of sacrifice. It was so
in the beginning, is now, and ever will
be, perhaps, for human nature is the
same “yesterday, today and forever.”</p>

<p>The man who believes that the autocratic
class in Russia will give up its
advantages without a fight is a superficial
student of history, just as the
man who believes that the dominating
trusts and corporations in these United
States can be made, by moral suasion,
to turn loose, is an idle dreamer who
knows nothing of the greed of class-rule.
No matter under what name it
exploits the people, or under what
form it exerts its power, or under
what particular system of legislation it
usurps control and veils its rascalities,
to make it <i>turn loose</i> you must beat it
in battle <span class="smcap">or make it afraid</span>.</p>

<h3>“<i>Give Them Free Passes and
They Will Become as Servants</i>”</h3>

<p>The manner in which the railway
pass can make honest men steal was
never illustrated more clearly than
when the Southern Railroad of J. P.
Morgan, a few days ago, filched
$142,000 from the taxpayers of this
country.</p>

<p>It was a shameless, impudent, vulgarly
common steal—nothing else.
The Congressmen who stole this money
for the Wall Street King, J. P. Morgan,
were led by the well-known statesman
of Alabama, John H. Bedstead.</p>

<p>Many and many a year ago a
stupid Post-Office Department adopted
the policy of paying subsidies to certain
railroads for the carriage of mails
which they had already contracted
to carry.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether a single
dollar of this money was well spent.
To secure the ridiculously high prices
which the government pays for the
carriage of the mail, the railroads
could always have been induced to
contract for as speedy a delivery as
was possible.</p>

<p>Subsidies could not make them do
more. Even a stupid P. O. Department
woke up to this fact, at last, and
quit paying the subsidies.</p>

<p>Mails were carried just as fast after
that as before.</p>

<p>The rate of payment is so high—the
plum so very luscious—that the
corporation could not refuse the contracts,
<i>especially when they could borrow
a rascally congressman’s frank, stuff
the bags with bogus mail, and thus secure
a false average of weight upon
which they were paid for the whole
year</i>.</p>

<p>(Congressman Livingston of Georgia
can tell you how this is done.)</p>

<p>But the Southern Railroad clung
to the subsidy.</p>

<p><i>It needed the money</i>, as Meredith
of Virginia once plaintively stated in
the House.</p>

<p>The P. O. Department no longer
asked it or advised it—but certain
congressmen from the South who are
ravenously fond of free passes stood
by the hungry corporation, and at
every session of Congress this subsidy
is voted.</p>

<p>The false pretense, used as an excuse,
is that it secures <i>fast mail for the South</i>.</p>

<p>There is no truth in the statement.
Under an ordinary contract for mail
carriage, the government can secure
precisely the same service as the
railroad gives in return for the subsidy.
In other words, the $142,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
is <i>a gift to the Wall Street Monarch,
J. P. Morgan</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. James H. Blount of Georgia was
for many years Chairman of the Committee
on Post-Offices and Post Roads.</p>

<p>He understood every detail of that
service. He bitterly opposed this subsidy.
I myself heard him denounce
it in the most wrathful manner; and
he declared on the floor of the House
that the people got nothing whatever
for it.</p>

<p>It was a donation—nothing more.</p>

<p>Blount’s place in Congress is now
partially filled by a different kind of
man—and the indignant protest of
the South against the contemplated
steal was not voiced by him or by
any other member from Georgia.</p>

<p>That honor was won by Tennessee.</p>

<p>When Hon. John A. Moon and
John Wesley Gaines denounced this
subsidy as it deserved, they earned
the applause and the grateful remembrance
of every honest man in the
South.</p>

<p>The Hon. R. B. Macon of Arkansas
also deserves the highest credit for his
opposition to the theft.</p>

<p>Of course, “Slippery Jim” Richardson
of Tennessee rushed to the relief
of the corporation, <i>as “Slippery Jim”
always does</i>, and the robbers, led by
the Bedstead statesman of Alabama,
prevailed.</p>

<p>The Congressman from Georgia, or
Alabama or any other Southern state
who helps Samuel Spencer and J. P.
Morgan steal the taxes of the people
upon the plea that it is done for the
benefit of the South, merits the scorn
and contempt of every decent Southern
man.</p>

<p>But those who excuse their votes
upon that pretense are hypocrites, or
dupes.</p>

<p>They know, or should know, that
the subsidy gives no benefit to the
South which she would not be entitled
to under an ordinary mail contract.</p>

<p>The Congressmen who stole this
money from the treasury for Morgan’s
Railroad were seduced <i>by the indirect
bribery of railway favors</i>—JUST THAT,
and NOTHING ELSE.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><i>Two Outlaws</i></h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a great
lawyer, orator, financier and statesman
who was honest. He bore himself
among men with the port of a
king, and even strangers, when they
passed him on the streets, would stop
and look back at that majestic figure
with involuntary admiration. To see
him was to get a new idea of the natural
impressiveness of a great man. To
hear him talk was to learn more than
you had ever dreamed of the infinite
variety of creative intellect.</p>

<p>I knew him well. And I looked up
to him as I have since looked up to the
higher summits of the Rocky Mountains—with
wondering awe for height
which I might never hope to reach.</p>

<p>Royal as this man was in all his ways,
his heart was warm and true. Pure
as the woman he called wife in his loyalty
to the marriage tie, his morality
recognized the double-life nowhere, and
he scorned all that was mean and false
and cruel and oppressive.</p>

<p>Always and everywhere he was for
the under-dog.</p>

<p>A more stalwart soldier of Right
never stood up in defense of the weak.</p>

<p>In a murder case he was able to
command a fee of ten thousand dollars;
but he was proudest of that triumph
he won in the court-house when
he volunteered to defend a penniless
negro, and saved the life of the accused
by tearing open his shirt and showing
the scars which the black man had
received on a battlefield in Virginia
while defending the life of his young
master.</p>

<p>Having incurred the displeasure of
the Federal authorities prior to the
Civil War and by certain conduct of
his during that war, the best Government
the world ever saw told him to
“git up and git”—and he did it. In
his native land he was outlawed.</p>

<p>He went to Europe for his health.</p>

<p>While waiting for the wrath of Thaddeus
Stevens to cool, he studied conditions
abroad—particularly the railroad
systems and the public schools.</p>

<p>Upon his return home he created a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
demand for a new Constitution for his
State, and in the convention which
framed it he was the undisputed leader.</p>

<p>The legislative appropriations for the
convention were spent before the Constitution
was finished, and the patriots
were about to disband. Average patriotism
moves on its belly, as an army
does.</p>

<p>The Georgia outlaw of whom I have
been writing borrowed $25,000 from
his Cotton Factors, and financed the
convention until the Constitution was
finished.</p>

<p>On two occasions only was this Outlaw
ever seen to weep in public—once
when the Constitutional Convention of
Georgia thanked him for his princely
generosity, and once when he stood at
the coffin of Alexander H. Stephens to
deliver the memorial address.</p>

<p>In the new Constitution of Georgia
the Outlaw believed he had embodied
three grand provisions:</p>

<p>(1) He had made the looting of the
treasury a difficult job.</p>

<p>(2) He had established a system of
public schools to educate at public expense
the children of the poor as well as
the rich.</p>

<p>(3) He had put a curb on corporation
tyranny; made it illegal for competitive
lines of railways to combine, and
had created a commission to regulate
and control the transportation companies.</p>

<p>This was the Georgia Outlaw’s proudest
work. He exulted over it; he regarded
it as his monument: he relied
on it to benefit his people for generations
to come.</p>

<p>In this belief he lived out the remnant
of his days, and in this belief he
died.</p>

<p>Where are now the competing railroads
in Georgia?</p>

<p>We have none. Mergers, leases, allied
interests have swallowed them all.
Monopoly rules from border to border.
Constitutional provisions are dead letters.</p>

<p>The corporations who nullify our law
and plunder our people keep paid corruptionists
busy all the year round to
defeat investigation and reform.</p>

<p>When the legislature meets, these
professional corruptionists all flock to
the Capitol. They remain throughout
the session.</p>

<p>If any member seeks to vindicate
the outraged Constitution, these lobbyists
employ every weapon known to
the armory of corruptionists to kill the
measure.</p>

<p>The campaign fund with which the
present Governor beat his competitor
was furnished by the railroads.</p>

<p>The notorious Hamp McWorter,
State lobbyist for the Southern Railroad,
was tendered a place on the Supreme
Bench by this Governor, who
owed his election to railroad money.</p>

<p>The Railroad Commission has been
reduced to a state bordering on imbecility.
If they pass orders which the
corporations dislike the orders are ignored.
They no more control the railroads
than the saddle on a horse controls
the horse.</p>

<p>Three excellent gentlemen draw comfortable
salaries for acting as commissioners;
the railroad lawyers have something
to play with; the corporations
are sometimes annoyed by having to
evade direct answers to troublesome
questions, and by having to get a Federal
Judge to discipline the Commission;
but that is about all.</p>

<p><i>J. P. Morgan is the absolute king of
the railroads of Georgia.</i></p>

<p>He makes the Governor, controls the
Legislature, overrides the Commission
and tramples the Constitution of the
State under his feet.</p>

<p>The Georgia Outlaw made the Constitution
for the good of the people;
the Wall Street Outlaw violates it for
the good of Wall Street plutocrats.</p>

<p>In making the Constitution, the
Georgia Outlaw had the help of the
best people of the State, and his work
was sanctioned by a popular vote after
it was finished.</p>

<p>In violating the Constitution, J. P.
Morgan has the aid of the worst men
in Georgia, and they dare not submit
their work to a free vote of the people.</p>

<p>The party machinery of the Democratic
party is prostituted to the vile
uses of the corporation lobbyists, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
the negro vote is held in reserve to be
used as a club to beat down any organized
opposition.</p>

<p>The Georgia Outlaw who made our
Constitution was a Democrat; the Wall
Street Outlaw who violates it is a Republican.</p>

<p>Georgia is a Democratic state. The
Democratic party is in full control of
every branch of the Government.</p>

<p>Thus we have an amazing spectacle.
A Republican Wall Street outlaw uses
the machinery of the Democratic party
in Georgia to trample upon the Constitution
and plunder the people.</p>

<p>What is the secret of this astonishing
situation?</p>

<p>Bribery—direct and indirect BRIBERY.</p>

<p>Daily and weekly newspapers subsidized;
rebates given to certain shippers;
favors granted where they will
do the most good; campaign funds supplied
to needy candidates; free passes
dealt out by the bushel; princely salaries
paid to plausible lobbyists.</p>

<p>Bribery, <i>bribery</i>, BRIBERY!</p>

<p>In no other way can you account for
such a shocking state of affairs.</p>

<p>When Democrats hold down a Democratic
State while a Wall Street Republican
robs it, there is just one explanation—only
one—BRIBERY.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><i>Building on Sand, Again</i></h3>

<p>With a strenuous rush and clang
and clatter, President Roosevelt has
set out to solve the Railroad
Problem.</p>

<p>All honor to him for the motive.
To his everlasting credit be it remembered
that he recognized the
abuses of the present system and
shouldered the task of reform.</p>

<p>But Mr. Roosevelt’s remedy will
never reach the seat of the disease.</p>

<p>In a case of blood poison, shin-plasters
for surface abrasions never
yet saved the patient; and Mr. Roosevelt’s
plans for another tribunal <i>to
control the railroads</i> are mere shin-plasters.</p>

<p>The trouble is that <i>the corporations
will control the new tribunals</i>,
just as they have controlled the old
ones.</p>

<p>The tremendous pressure which combined
capital can bring to bear upon
any tribunal which Congress creates
will be irresistible in the future, as it
has been in the past. Poor human
nature is simply unable to withstand
temptations which assume so many
seductive forms, and intimidations
which assail natural weakness in such
a variety of ways. So vast is the
power of the corporations to reward
or punish, enrich or impoverish, that
individuals sink into nothingness by
comparison. No man is beyond their
reach. If they cannot act upon the
official himself, they can strike him
through his family, or relatives, or
friends, or business connections.</p>

<p>Somewhere, within the little world
in which he lives, they will find someone
who will yield to their temptations
or surrender to their power to
hurt.</p>

<p>Railroads have been known to do
great things for the son of a Judge
who was about to try an important
case.</p>

<p>Governors, Senators, Judges, Railroad
Commissioners sometimes have
relatives who are more or less willing
to get hold of a good thing.</p>

<p>The wives of the same sometimes
have approachable kinsmen who, for a
consideration, are willing to speak
superciliously of the “demagogues”
who assail corporations.</p>

<p>Then, again, the newspapers—those
busy bees!—can be so trained by
corporation cunning that they will
give us their sting instead of their
honey.</p>

<p>If Sir Statesman votes with a
serene disregard for Sir Demagogue,
giving the railroads what they want,
Editorial prowess will take care of him.
His praises will resound, until his
sublime head bumps against the stars.
But should he be his own master,
obeying no orders save those of his
conscience, the corporation organs
can so belittle him, slander him, and
manufacture lies about him, that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
almost grows ashamed of having been
honest.</p>

<p>In short, the corporation can make
“a good time” for those who serve it,
and “a bad time” for those who defy
it.</p>

<p><i>Do not all men know this?</i></p>

<p>The more necessary any official is
to combined capital, the more they
will do for him, or against him.</p>

<p>Create any tribunal which becomes
an absolute necessity to the corporations—a
matter of life and death to
them—and they will either tempt it
with bribes which no virtue can resist,
or assail it with intimidations which
no courage can defy.</p>

<p>Mr. President, have you studied the
history of “The Granger Cases” of
thirty years ago? If not, study it.
Then you will know better how the
corporations control human tribunals
and get rid of laws which are obstacles.</p>

<p>Have you studied the recent decisions
of the Federal Judges on the
question of fixing “reasonable rates”?
If not, study them.</p>

<p>You will then know better what a
monkey a railroad lawyer can make
of a Federal Judge.</p>

<p>To create another tribunal for the
purpose of controlling the railroads, is
simply the building of another house
upon sand.</p>

<p>The only solution of the Railroad
Problem is national ownership, <i>which
takes away the motive to do wrong</i>.</p>

<p>In no other way can you cure the
disease.</p>

<p>Instead of establishing another
Court, or Commission, for the corporations
to play with, assert the
principle of Eminent Domain, assess
the railroads at a fair valuation, pay
for them partly in treasury notes and
partly in twenty-year two per cent.
bonds, place the general management
of the property under the Interior Department—and
<i>then</i> the railroads will
no more think of free passes, rebates
and discriminations than the Post-Office
service does of free stamps, or privileged
patrons who must be enriched
at the expense of the other patrons.</p>

<h3><i>Look at England</i></h3>

<p><i>Collier’s Weekly</i> thinks that the
United States should pay higher salaries.
Ambassadors do not get enough.
Neither do cabinet officers. The
President also is underpaid. How
lamentable!</p>

<p>“Look at England,” says <i>Collier’s</i>,
in effect.</p>

<p>England pays $100,000 to the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, $35,000 to the
Speaker of the House of Commons, and
so forth and so on.</p>

<p>Well, let us accept the invitation, and
<i>look at England</i>.</p>

<p><i>Who pays the taxes in England?</i> We
know who pays them here. With us
the poor man pays the tax.</p>

<p>When he covers his nakedness, when
he satisfies his hunger, when he builds
his house, when he buys tools to work
with, he pays an outrageously oppressive
Tariff tax.</p>

<p>Rockefeller pays no more Federal
tax than is paid by many a one-horse
negro farmer in the South.</p>

<p>Morgan pays less Federal tax than
many a Western corn-grower who fed
his stove on ear corn in 1891, because
it was cheaper than coal.</p>

<p>Blessed are our millionaires! Those
of them who are neglected by Congress
are tenderly cared for by the Federal
judiciary.</p>

<p>Blessed are the rich!—they run the
government, and the common man
pays the bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Look at England!</span></p>

<p>All right, we now look. This is
what we see:</p>

<p><i>She compels her railway corporations
to pay an Income Tax</i> upon the assessed
valuation of $190,000,000.</p>

<p><i>She compels the Coal Barons and the
marble quarry owners to pay Income
Tax</i> upon an assessed valuation of
$95,000,000.</p>

<p><i>She compels the landlords, bankers
and merchant princes to pay Income
Tax</i> upon an assessed valuation of
$900,000,000.</p>

<p>In this manner <i>she forces her wealthy
classes</i> to pay on property and income
nearly <i>two hundred million dollars annually</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
toward the support of the government!</p>

<p><i>Her tariff duties are levied exclusively
upon articles which are <span class="smcap">not</span> necessaries
of life.</i></p>

<p>Not a dollar of Tariff need the poor
man pay to live in perfect comfort.</p>

<p>This tariff upon the non-necessaries
amounts to $170,000,000.</p>

<p>From intoxicating liquors the revenue
is $150,000,000.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen, by a look at
England, that <i>the poor man can feed
himself, clothe himself, build a house to
live in, and supply it with necessary
furniture without having to pay one
dollar of national tax</i>.</p>

<p>In this land of the free <i>he must pay
the Tariff tax, or go naked, eat grass, and
live in a hole in the ground</i>.</p>

<p>But let us “look at England” again.</p>

<p>We see her operating her Post-Office,
carrying parcels as well as letters.
She does not allow express companies
to amass fortunes by robbing the
people in the carrying of light freight.</p>

<p>Thus she makes $70,000,000 instead
of letting the corporations make five
times that amount.</p>

<p>She owns and operates the telegraph
lines, and makes $18,000,000 per year
instead of letting the corporations make
it.</p>

<p>What, therefore, is the net result of
the “Look at England”?</p>

<p>We discover that <i>the government
supports itself upon the possessions of
the people rather than upon their necessities</i>.</p>

<p>Give us the same system of taxation—compel
<i>those who possess the wealth to
pay the</i> expenses of government—and
I, for one, will say, “<i>Make the salaries
what you will so long as you, who make
them, have to pay them</i>.”</p>

<h3><i>Editorial Comments</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Notoriously</span>, you cannot convict
a cow-thief when eleven of the jury
got part of the beef. Judge Swayne
owes his escape to similar conditions.
He was acquitted by the United States
Senate not because he was innocent,
but because he was regular. He had
not done anything which the Senatorial
Jury does not constantly do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A railroad fell into the Federal Court
of which Swayne happened to be the
presiding judge. Swayne possesses
and controls this railroad through the
medium of a receiver. In law and in
morals Swayne is the trustee of the
property, administering it for the benefit
of the owners—the stockholders.
Had he put his fingers into the cash-drawer
at the ticket office and stolen
five dollars, his crime would have been
clear, indefensible. Proof of such an
act would have compelled a unanimous
verdict of guilty—even in the United
States Senate—for Senators do not do
it that way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But Swayne knows how the game is
played, and he played according to rule.</p>

<p>That is to say, he made use of the
trust funds which were in his possession
and control, to fit himself up a palace
car and stock it with the best eatables
and drinkables. He then took on, as
a retinue of servants, the employees
who were paid to work for the stockholders,
and appropriated car, provisions,
employees and all to his own
private purposes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With this luxurious car, upon which
he had spent the trust funds committed
to his care, he took himself and family
on long pleasure trips to his native
place in Delaware. In this rolling
palace he and his family enjoyed a
tour of the West.</p>

<p>The sum total of the trust funds
which he thus converted to his own use
could not have been less than thousands
of dollars, for the car and its
equipment would have been worth
hundreds of dollars per day had it been
used by its owners, the stockholders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These facts were not denied.</p>

<p>In law and morals, Judge Swayne
misappropriated trust funds.</p>

<p>He did not go to the cash-drawer at
the ticket office and steal five dollars,
but he took charge of the car, the supplies
and the employees whose services<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
would have put thousands of dollars
into the cash-drawers, and thus converted
to his own private use the property
which was in his Court for management
and final disposition.</p>

<p>Here was a plain case of dishonest use
of power and opportunity.</p>

<p>Here was a plain case of robbery—the
Federal Judge taking that which
belonged to the stockholders and which
should have earned them thousands of
dollars.</p>

<p>In morals and sound law, the crime
is the same as it would have been had
he embezzled the same sum in dollars
and cents.</p>

<p>The Washington <i>Post</i> argues that
the President should have a salary of
$100,000.</p>

<p>All right. Let us levy a tax or two
on the rich, and raise the salaries which
the organs of the rich say are too small.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the President is discontented with
his pay, why doesn’t he throw up his
job?</p>

<p>I know several fellows who will take
it at the present price.</p>

<p>There is W. J. B., for instance.</p>

<p>I haven’t the faintest doubt that he
would be willing to quit editing <i>The
Commoner</i> and assume Presidential
burdens at $50,000 per year. It would
be easier work, don’t you know, than
making twenty-two speeches a day
for a candidate like Parker, a platform
like that of St. Louis 1904, and a
National Chairman like Tom Taggart—the
gambling-hell man of Indiana.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Governor Folk, of Missouri, was
elected to stop boodling, banish bribery
and otherwise purify the political atmosphere.</p>

<p>A bill was promptly introduced into
the Legislature to make it possible to
convict and punish bribery.</p>

<p>The Senate promptly killed the bill.</p>

<p>Folk is still Governor, however.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Populists throughout the country
regard with demure interest the modest
strides which Kansas is taking in State-Socialism.</p>

<p>That Republican State is to own and
operate oil refineries to the end that
Rockefeller’s Trust may not swallow
the earth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides the Kansas State refinery,
the Republican legislature favors other
things which are <i>almost</i> new under the
sun.</p>

<p>No trust, corporation or private
partnership shall be allowed to sell
cheaper in one place than in another in
Kansas—freight being deducted.</p>

<p>All over that State the price must be
the same.</p>

<p>Maximum freight rates have been
established, oil pipe lines have been
made common carriers, and the pumping
of Kansas gas out of Kansas forbidden.</p>

<p>Is it possible that we Populists are to
find ourselves reduced to a state of
mere “eminent respectability” by such
thoroughgoing revolutionists as the
Republicans of Kansas?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Washington <i>Post</i> says:</p>

<p>“After Kansas gets her oil refinery in
operation she may find that Mr. Rockefeller
will not allow his railroads to
carry its product.”</p>

<p>When Rockefeller refuses to haul
Kansas oil because Kansas operates a
refinery he will probably discover that
Kansas can do a thing or two against
his railroads.</p>

<p>When Theodore Roosevelt was a
very, very young man, he wrote a
“Life of Gouverneur Morris” in which
the youthful author sweepingly classified
Tom Paine as “a filthy little
atheist.”</p>

<p>Now that Teddy has grown great
upon the meat which Cæsar fed on,
the University of Pennsylvania has conferred
an Honorary Degree upon him.</p>

<p>This is the same institution which
conferred an Honorary Degree upon
Tom Paine.</p>

<p>So there you are.</p>

<p>To the extent that the University
of Pennsylvania can equalize the
eminence of Teddy and Tom, equality
has been established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>So far as the University of Pennsylvania
can link the two names together,
they are linked.</p>

<p>Whether he likes it or not, Teddy
must promenade down the corridors
of time and fame arm in arm with
the “filthy little atheist.”</p>

<p>Here is a case where that one of
the Grecian philosophers who laughed
at everything would weep: and where
that one who wept at everything
would laugh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom Paine being dead cannot resent
the honors paid Roosevelt by
any act of renunciation aimed at the
University of Pennsylvania; but Teddy
lives and can defend his virtue from
contaminating contact.</p>

<p>Will he tamely submit to wear the
Academic honor tainted by the touch
of Tom Paine, or will he spurn it with
that disdain which condensed the
career of a much-enduring, much-achieving
patriot and democrat in
the cruelly scornful words, “a dirty
little atheist”?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whenever, in the hour of gloom
and doubt, we call upon the presidents
of our world-famous colleges
for guidance we get it. Which is one
of the reasons why we are still in the
dark.</p>

<p>A couple of years since, the chief
sage of one of these world-famous
institutions told us that Social Ostracism
was the medicine for the Trust
evil which would prove a cure-all.</p>

<p>The chief sage neglected to inform
us how and when we should or could
dose the wicked corporations with
this medicine: hence we have not as
yet socially ostracized J. P. Morgan,
Ogden Armour or John D. Rockefeller.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Woodrow Wilson, chief sage of
Princeton University, is the latest
of the academic guides who offers to
pilot us out of the gloom.</p>

<p>“Trusts,” remarks Woodrow (who,
just between you and me, is something
of a prig), “Trusts can never
be abolished.”</p>

<p>“<i>We must moralize them.</i>”</p>

<p>“The thing that keeps water in
stocks is secrecy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Publicity is the remedy.</i>”</p>

<p>When we hear the chief sage of
Princeton droning and driveling this
sort of nonsense we wonder whether
his mind is fixed upon the actual men,
methods and standards of today, or
whether he gropes in some Arcadia
of the past.</p>

<p>“<i>Moralize the Trusts?</i>”</p>

<p>How will you do it, impractical
prig?</p>

<p>Mr. Rockefeller is moral, isn’t he?
Goes to church every Sunday, endows
Baptist colleges, sends young
John to teach Sabbath school and
attend English revivals, prates of
morality and the Bible to equal any
Pecksniff that ever stole the livery of
the Lord to shear the sheep in.</p>

<p>Yet where was there ever a more
ruthless criminal on the face of the
earth than Rockefeller’s Oil Trust?</p>

<p>“The thing that keeps water in
stocks is secrecy.”</p>

<p>No, it isn’t, impractical prig.</p>

<p>It’s water that keeps the water in
the stocks.</p>

<p>Secrecy has nothing to do with
it.</p>

<p><i>The public always knows when the
watering is done!</i></p>

<p>It was so with the Steel Combine;
it has been so with every railroad
reorganization which Morgan has managed;
it was so with Amalgamated
Copper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“<i>Publicity is the remedy!</i>” says Woodrow,
the Sage.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<p>Does the knowledge that we are
being robbed stop the robbery?</p>

<p>There is no secrecy about the Beef
Trust. Publicity there has run riot.</p>

<p>We know all about the Refrigerator
car, the rebate, the discriminations,
the Big Stick methods, the colossal,
un-Godly profits.</p>

<p>We know how the cattle owner is
robbed when the Trust buys, and how
the consumer of dressed meat is
robbed when he buys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>What good does the Publicity do us?</p>

<p>None at all.</p>

<p>It makes us rage and rant, but
the Trust gets our money just the
same.</p>

<p>Have not Lawson and Russell and
Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens and
a dozen others put the flashlight upon
all these monstrous piratical combinations
until the very children are
familiar with the details?</p>

<p><i>Publicity?</i></p>

<p>Why, if there is anything that we
have got a lavish supply of, just now,
<i>it is Publicity</i>.</p>

<p>What we haven’t got is RELIEF.</p>

<p>If <i>Publicity</i> were a cure for the disease,
we’d have been well long ago.</p>

<p>As it is, the evil grows worse, day
by day, in spite of all the <i>Publicity</i>.</p>

<p>Go back to thy gerund-grinding,
Woodrow—thou insufferable, impractical
prig. Among the dead Greeks
and the extinct Romans thy labors
may, haply, be useful; but when thou
comest among the practical men of
today seeking to master actual conditions
and to take part in the great
battle of thought, motive and purpose
which rages around us, thou art but
“a babby, and a gal babby at that.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Bryan says, in his <i>Commoner</i>,
that “the movement begun in 1896
would have succeeded in 1900 had it
not been for the Spanish War and
the increase of the gold supply.”</p>

<p>What a superficial view!</p>

<p>First of all, the “movement” did
not begin in 1896.</p>

<p>It began when the West and South
were brought together by the Farmers’
Alliance in 1890. It was in full swing
when it gave General Weaver 1,200,000
votes in 1892. It was running like a
millrace when it polled 1,800,000 in the
local elections of 1894. It would
have scored a triumph in 1896 had the
Democratic leaders acted honestly with
the Populists.</p>

<p>After 1896 the “movement” lost
strength every day.</p>

<p>In 1900 it was doomed to defeat before
the campaign opened.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yes; the reform “movement” was in
full swing in 1890, and one of the good
things it did was to float into Congress
a promising young lawyer named Bryan.</p>

<p>To the Populist movement W. J. B.
owes his rise, for there were then no
Democrats to speak of in Nebraska.</p>

<p>Populist votes carried his home State
for him in 1896, when he ran for President
against McKinley.</p>

<p>In 1900 Nebraska went Republican,
although the same Bryan was running
against the same McKinley.</p>

<p>They are hunting, in Paris, for the
bones of John Paul Jones, the first and
greatest sea captain who ever flew the
Stars and Stripes from the masthead of
a battleship, and “held the ocean lists
against the world in mail.”</p>

<p>Congress gives $35,000 to find the
bones, and of course they will be found—not
those of the original Jones, perhaps,
but a good enough lot of bones
for that amount of money.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Had Gouverneur Morris, the American
Minister to France, done his duty
at the time of Paul Jones’s death, by
giving him a respectable funeral and a
modest tombstone, the people of this
country would not now be taxed $35,000
to find the hero’s grave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When John Paul Jones—old, broken
and poor—lay dying in Paris, our
high-toned Minister to France, Gouverneur
Morris, sat feasting with aristocratic
company, and that high-toned
Minister failed to mark the grave of a
man who with Nelson’s chances might
have done even more than Nelson on
the sea.</p>

<p>His grave was made in an obscure
churchyard, his resting-place neglected
and forgotten, covered with accumulated
deposits, and built over with
houses.</p>

<p>Those who seek the bones are sinking
holes seventeen feet deep, in the
search.</p>

<p>Of course, they will find the body
of Commodore Jones. That is what
they are hunting for. Therefore, they
will find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>But whether the dust they bring
back to America will be that of <i>our</i>
Paul Jones no mortal will ever know.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his Diary, Gouverneur Morris
relates:</p>

<p>“A message from Paul Jones that
he is dying.</p>

<p>“I go thither and make his will....
Send for a Notary, <i>and leave
him struggling with his enemy</i>.”</p>

<p>The American Minister to France
left Paul Jones struggling with
death!</p>

<p>Left him alone with a French
Notary, and went away.</p>

<p>To do what?</p>

<p>To “dine with Lord Gower and
Lady Sutherland”!</p>

<p>The American Minister knew that
Paul Jones was dying, for he says so.</p>

<p>After the dinner with the English
Lord and Lady, does the American
Minister hasten back to the bedside
of the fellow-countryman whom he
had left “struggling with his enemy”?</p>

<p>By no means.</p>

<p>He goes to the Louvre to look
at the paintings; and then takes
Talleyrand’s mistress with him to
Jones’s lodging.</p>

<p>“But he is dead—<i>not yet cold</i>.”</p>

<p>And this is all that Gouverneur
Morris’s Diary records of Paul Jones’s
death, until the indignation aroused in
America by his shocking lack of attention
to the dying hero had thrown him
upon the defensive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Who paid the burial expenses of
Paul Jones?</p>

<p>A Frenchman claims that he did it.</p>

<p>Morris, in his Diary, certainly seeks
to make the impression that he paid
them out of Jones’s estate.</p>

<p>The hero left sufficient property
for the purpose, as can easily be
shown. Further than that we are left
in doubt.</p>

<p>But Morris was requested to authorize
a public funeral, in which fitting
honors should be paid to the dead.
Morris refused. He states that he
(Morris) desired “a private and economical
funeral.”</p>

<p>He got it. The funeral was so
economical and so private that neither
the tongue of repute, identifying the
grave from generation to generation,
nor the more unerring evidence of
shaft or vault guides the footsteps
of those who come so late, so late!
to repair the neglect of a hundred
years.</p>

<h3><i>How Private Ownership
Breaks Down</i></h3>

<p>In the great city of New York there
is a Subway, an underground street,
which was opened at the expense of
the taxpayers. Every dollar of the
enormous expenditure came out of
the pockets of the citizens of New
York. After this Subway had been
completed and paid for by the people,
it was turned over to a private corporation
to be used for private profit.
It is unnecessary to say that such a
stupendous piece of folly could never
have been committed by wise men or
honest men. On the face of it, the
transaction reeks with rascality.</p>

<p>Let us, however, contemplate actual
results. The men to whom the property
was given operate the Subway
to make all the money that is possible
out of the franchise. In doing so they
have come into collision with their
employees. The disagreement results
in a strike. The experienced
operators of the cars leave them. Inexperienced
men take hold. The
necessary consequence is danger to
life and limb, which only the careless or
reckless would incur.</p>

<p>The thousands of people in New
York, to whom the Subway is a daily
necessity, are incommoded and injured.
The entire city suffers because
of the dispute between the corporation
and its employees.</p>

<p>I will not enter into the question as
to who is to blame for the strike. It is
sufficient to say that under private
ownership of this public thoroughfare
the strike does occur and all of its evil
consequences naturally follow. No matter
whether Belmont is right or wrong;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
no matter whether his employees are
right or wrong, the effect upon the
public is precisely the same. The
public gets hurt. The public suffers
and the public is helpless. Such a
situation is surely sufficient to arouse
thought and investigation.</p>

<p>Ever since we have allowed private
corporations to take charge of public
utilities we have had the strike, the
riot, the loss of money, the loss of life.
As long as private ownership continues
to exploit these things which belong
to the public, we will continue to have
the strike, the riot, loss of money and
the loss of life.</p>

<p>I say nothing about the amount of
which the traveling public is robbed
by these corporations which own the
public utilities. I confine myself simply
and solely to this thought, namely,
that under private ownership the situation,
which now confronts the traveling
public of New York City, is liable to
happen at any time and at any place
throughout the Union where public
franchises are used for selfish and
private gain.</p>

<p>That is the fruit of the tree. It always
has been; it always will be.
That kind of tree will <i>never</i> bear any
other sort of fruit.</p>

<p>Then why not cut it down?</p>

<p>Public ownership removes the <i>motive</i>
for misuse of public utilities, and when
the motive goes the evil will go. As
long as selfishness and greed get <i>the
chance</i> to gratify themselves at the
public expense, just so long will they
do it.</p>

<p>In every conflict between Capital
and Labor the public loses—no matter
whether Capital wins or Labor wins.</p>

<p>Public ownership would do for the
railroads what it does for the Post-Office,
the Police Department or the
Fire Department. Who ever heard of
a strike among the Post-Office employees?
Or in the police force? Or
among the firemen?</p>

<p>In Germany the railroads are owned
and operated by the Government, and
nobody ever heard of traffic being
blocked by a strike. In Austria the
story is the same. In Australia it is
the same. In New Zealand it is the
same. Nowhere on earth, so far as I
know, has there ever been a strike
when the principle of government
ownership was in operation. Take
those cities of England where the street
cars are owned and operated by the
city government. Who has ever heard
of a strike on those lines? From Liverpool
to Birmingham and from Birmingham
to Glasgow you will find the
principle of public ownership applied
with perfect success, and nowhere has
the operation of public utilities by the
public been stopped by a strike.</p>

<p>It seems almost impossible for the
people of our great cities to learn the
lesson taught by our own troubles, and
taught further by the object-lessons
furnished us by nationalities which
are not such cowardly slaves of the
corporations as we seem to be. The
most amazing feature in American life
today is the audacity with which
predatory corporations ride forth, like
the feudal barons of olden times, to
strike down the average citizen and
rob him of what he makes as fast as
he makes it. Individually, we have
plenty of courage, but, collectively,
we are the most cowardly creatures on
earth. The communal spirit seems to
be dead within us. Public opinion is
in its infancy. The strength which
lies dormant within us because of our
numbers seems to be a fact of which
the masses are totally ignorant.</p>

<p>Acting swiftly, acting with unity
of purpose, acting with the keenest intelligence,
acting with a magnificent
courage, the outlaws of modern commercialism
dash at their object with
superb confidence in their prowess,
and they have seized and ridden away
with the spoils before the drowsy,
ignorant and timid public have awakened
to the fact that they have been
raided, stricken down and plundered.</p>

<p>If the city government of New York
had at its head a man “with a beard
on his chin,” he could find a way to
solve this Subway problem and all
kindred problems within a few weeks,
and in such a manner that it would
never be presented again. He would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
have to be intelligent, he would have
to be honest, he would have to be
brave, but if he had these qualities and
were, besides, a patriot wishing to do
what is best for the entire community,
he could win a victory which would
repeat itself in all the centres of our
population, and which would terminate
the reign of rascality which
now exploits, for personal ends, the
powers and the opportunities of public
office in almost every great city of this
Republic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You ask me <i>how</i> could the Mayor do
anything, when the Subway is legally
in the hands of a Commission created
by the Legislature?</p>

<p>I answer that the city has the right
to use its streets. One of its sovereign
powers, inherent and absolute, is that
of keeping its streets open for the safe
and free use of every citizen. Nobody
has the right to block travel or traffic,
nor can the Legislature grant such a
privilege.</p>

<p>As to the Subway, it is a street
under the ground. True, the <i>methods</i>
which he would have to employ differ
from those which he would apply to a
surface street, but the <i>principle</i> would
be precisely the same in the one case
as in the other.</p>

<p>He could say to Belmont and his
employees: “You are blocking the
streets. You are interfering with the
rights of the people who paid for the
Subway and who want to use it. You
and your disputes are as nothing to
me in comparison with the duty which
I owe to the city. <i>Arbitrate your difference</i>,
or I will exert the full sovereign
power of the municipality to
seize the Subway and to open it to
travel.</p>

<p>“And you needn’t run to any judge
for an injunction, either. In the exercise
of supreme executive authority
policing the city and keeping open its
streets, I shall tolerate no interference
whatever from corporation lawyers or
corporation judges. I give you fair
warning: <i>Arbitrate</i>, and do it quickly—else
the city takes what is hers, and
operates the cars which you have tied
up!”</p>

<p>Who doubts that a threat like this,
made by the right kind of Mayor,
would bring Belmont to his senses in
a couple of minutes? Arbitrate! Of
course he would arbitrate—quickly
and gladly.</p>

<p>And the Mayor would have the
enthusiastic support of ninety-nine
men out of every hundred in New
York.</p>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A TOY horse or a raspberry-tart
is not often responsible for the
loss of a life, but a succession
of toy horses, raspberry-tarts, and
whatever else the heart of a small boy
craved, given in a reckless abandonment
of superfluity, was certainly responsible
for the wilfulness in the character
of Paul Weston; and the wilfulness,
in turn, was responsible for the
quarrel.</p>

<p>At twenty he was a restless, impulsive,
good-hearted, broad-chested,
strong-limbed young fellow, the adored
of his mother and the pride of his
father. And yet it was over the prostrate
form of this same father that he
now stood—the crack of the revolver
still ringing in his ears, the weapon itself
still clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>Was the man dead? But a minute
before he had been speaking; now
there was a fast-growing pool of
something dark and horrible on the
floor at his side.</p>

<p>Paul Weston brushed the back of
his left hand across his eyes and
looked down at the still smoking
revolver. Had his miserable temper
brought him to this? His features
worked convulsively and his eyes
widened in horror. Throwing the revolver
from him to the farthermost
corner of the room, he turned and fled.</p>

<p>Out the door, through the gate, and
down the long street of the little New
England village he ran. It was dusk,
but he stumbled as though it were the
darkness of midnight.</p>

<p>The neighbors looked and wondered
at the fleeing figure, but only their
eyes spoke disapproval. If Paul Weston
chose to use the main street of the
village as a race-course, it was not for
them to interfere—they knew him too
well. The town fool alone ventured
to accost him.</p>

<p>“Hi, there—go it! What’s after
ye?” he shouted; but the jeering
words and the vacant smile died on
his lips at sight of the face Paul turned
upon him.</p>

<p>Down the street, across the open
field, and over the fence at a bound—surely
the friendly shelter of the woods
receded as he ran! But his pace did
not slacken even in the dense shadows
of the forest. On and on, stumbling,
falling, tearing his flesh and his clothing
on the thorns and brambles until,
exhausted, he dropped on a grassy
mound, miles away from that dread
thing he had left behind him.</p>

<p>The wind sighed and whispered over
his head. Weston had always loved
the sound, but tonight it was only an
accusing moan in his ears. Even the
stars that peeped through the leaves
above were like menacing eyes seeking
out his hiding-place.</p>

<p>An owl hooted; Weston raised his
head and held his breath. Then
through the forest came the baying of
a distant hound. The man was on his
feet in an instant. Something tightened
in his throat and his heart-beats
came in slow, suffocating throbs. He
knew that sound! They sought for—murderers
with creatures like that!
With a bound he was away on his wild
race again. Hours later, the gray
dawn and his nearness to a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
village warned him to move more
cautiously.</p>

<p>All that day he tramped, without
rest, without food, reaching at night
the seaport town that had been his
goal. Skulking through the back
streets he came to a cheap eating-house
down by the wharves.</p>

<p>The odor of greasily fried meats and
bad coffee floated out the open door,
causing Weston to sniff hungrily. In
a moment he had thrown caution to
the winds, entered the restaurant and
slunk into the nearest seat.</p>

<p>By his side lay a discarded newspaper.
He reached for it with a shaking
hand, then snatched his fingers
back as though the printed sheet had
scorched them. No, oh, no—he dared
not look at it! His mind’s eye pictured
the headlines, black with horror:</p>

<p class="center">“MURDER! PARRICIDE! THE<br />
FIEND STILL AT LARGE!”</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and rushed
from the room. An hour later he had
shipped as a sailor on a vessel bound
for San Francisco around Cape Horn.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The cracker-barrels and packing-boxes
that usually served for seats in
Pedler Jim’s store were, strange to say,
unoccupied. Bill Somers, sole representative
of “the boys,” sat cross-legged
on the end of the counter, meditatively
eying a dozen flies that were
buzzing happily around a drop of
molasses nearby. Pedler Jim himself
occupied his customary stool behind
the counter.</p>

<p>It was ten years now since the little
hunchback pedler first appeared in
Skinner Valley. He came from no
one knew where, driving a battered
and worn horse attached to a yet more
battered and worn pedler’s cart. The
horse had promptly taken advantage
of the stop in the village, and by dying
had made sure of never leaving the
place for the wearisome trail again.
The miners say that the night the old
horse died, its master patted and
stroked the poor dead head until it
was cold and stiff, and that the morning
found him fondling the useless reins
with his shriveled, misshapen fingers.</p>

<p>The next day he bartered for a tiny
piece of land fronting the main street.
When he had wheeled his old cart into
proper position upon it, he busied
himself some time with a bit of board
and a paint pot, finally producing a
rough sign bearing the single word
“Store.” This creation he nailed with
much satisfaction upon the front of
the dashboard, then sat down on one
of the thills to wait for a customer.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the oddity of the
thing; or perhaps there was something
in the deformed little body that appealed
to the strong-limbed, straight-backed
miners; or perhaps it was the
wonderful knowledge of healing herbs
and soothing lotions that Pedler Jim
possessed—perhaps it was a little of all
three. At all events, the new store
prospered amazingly so that in a
year its owner bought more land,
trundled the old cart to the rear, and
erected a small cabin on his lot. This,
in turn, gave place to a good-sized
frame building bearing the imposing
gilt-lettered sign:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">James A. Powers</span>,<br />
<i>Skinner Valley Emporium</i>.</p>

<p>The hunchback rolled this high-sounding
title under his tongue with
keen relish, but it was still “the store”
to the boys, and its owner was only
“Pedler Jim.”</p>

<p>Bill Somers shifted his position on
the end of the counter and poked a
teasing finger at the agitated mass of
wings and legs around the molasses
drop. The storekeeper grinned appreciatively
and broke the silence:</p>

<p>“Say, who’s yer new man?”</p>

<p>“Blest if I know.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got a name, hain’t he?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he has—then again, mebbe
he hain’t.”</p>

<p>“But don’t ye call him nothin’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we <i>call</i> him ‘Hustler Joe’; but
that ain’t no name to hitch a grocery
bill on to—eh, Jim?”</p>

<p>The little hunchback slid from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
stool and brought his fist down hard
on the counter.</p>

<p>“That’s jest the point! He don’t
git much, but what he does git he pays
fur—spot cash. An’ that’s more’n I
can say of some of the rest of ye,” he
added, with a reproachful look.</p>

<p>Bill laughed and stretched his long
legs.</p>

<p>“I s’pose, now, that’s a dig at me,
Jim.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t call no names.”</p>

<p>“I know yer lips didn’t, but yer eyes
did. Say, how much do I owe, anyhow?”</p>

<p>With manifest alacrity Jim darted
over to the pine box that served for a
desk.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no hurry, Jim,” drawled
Somers, with a slow smile. “I
wouldn’t put ye out fur nothin’!”</p>

<p>The storekeeper did not hear. He
was rapidly turning the greasy, well-thumbed
pages of the account-book
before him.</p>

<p>“It’s jest twenty dollars and fourteen
cents, now, Bill,” he said, his
brown forefinger pausing after a run
down one of the pages. “Ye hain’t
paid nothin’ since Christmas, ye know,”
he added significantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Bill, with another
slow smile, “mebbe ’twouldn’t do no
harm if I ponied up a bit!” And he
plunged both hands into his trousers
pockets.</p>

<p>Pedler Jim smiled and edged nearer,
while Bill drew out a handful of change
and laboriously picked out a dime and
four pennies.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, slapping the fourteen
cents on the counter, “now it’s
even dollars!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” cried Pedler
Jim, turning his back and walking
over to the window.</p>

<p>Somers looked after the retreating
figure, and a broad smile lighted up his
round red face. Slipping his hand inside
his coat he pulled out a roll of
greenbacks. In another minute the
fourteen cents lay neatly piled on top
of two ten-dollar bills. The man
hastily slipped into his old position and
coughed meaningly.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t seem pleased,” he began.</p>

<p>The hunchback did not stir.</p>

<p>“Mebbe ye don’t want my money,”
hazarded the miner.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I can take it back,” and
Somers shuffled noisily off his seat.</p>

<p>Pedler Jim wheeled about and came
down the store with his small black
eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“Jiminy Christmas, man! If you
ain’t enough ter try a saint! I’m
blest if I can git mad at ye, though, fur
all yer pesterin’ ways. Now what in
thunder—” The storekeeper’s jaw
dropped, and his mouth fell open idiotically
as his eyes rested on the greenbacks.
“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” he
murmured again, and clutched the
money in his claw-like fingers.</p>

<p>At that moment the outer door
opened to admit a tall, broad-shouldered
miner wearing a slouch hat well
over his eyes. In a trice Pedler Jim
was the obsequious merchant behind
the counter.</p>

<p>The newcomer gave his order in a
low voice and stood motionless while
the hunchback busied himself in filling
it.</p>

<p>“Anything else?” suggested Jim
wistfully, as he pushed a small package
toward him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess that’ll do for this time,”
returned the man, picking up his purchase
and motioning toward a dollar
bill on the counter.</p>

<p>Pedler Jim looked up quickly and
something like tenderness came into
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I—guess you’re from Yankee-land,
stranger; shake, won’t ye?” he said,
thrusting his hand across the counter.
“Gorry! but it’s prime ter see a good
old New Englander among all these
dagos and Dutchmen and the Lord
only knows what else here. Bill an’
me was gittin’ lonesome—I’m glad ye
come!”</p>

<p>At Jim’s first words the stranger
had stepped back, but the outstretched
hand had brought him to the counter
again, and he gave the brown fingers
a grip that made the little hunchback<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
wince with pain. But Pedler Jim’s
welcome was scarcely spoken before
the man had turned and disappeared
through the door.</p>

<p>“Well, I snum! I should think he
was ‘Hustler Joe’!” murmured Jim.
“If he didn’t even hustle off and leave
his change,” he added, looking helplessly
at the dollar bill on the counter.</p>

<p>Somers laughed.</p>

<p>“Hustle!—you’d oughter see him at
the mines! why, that man works like
all possessed. He don’t speak nor look
at a soul of us ’nless he has to. If
there’s a chance ter work extry—he gits
it; an’ he acts abused ’cause he can’t
work every night and Sundays to
boot. Gosh! I can’t understand him,”
finished Bill, with a yawn and a long
stretch.</p>

<p>“That ain’t ter be wondered at—’tain’t
‘Hustler Bill’ that the boys call
you,” replied Jim, a sly twinkle in his
beady little eyes.</p>

<p>Somers sprang to his feet and towered
over the hunchback, his fist
raised in pretended wrath.</p>

<p>“Why don’t ye take a feller yer own
size?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The hunchback chuckled, dove under
the upraised arm, and skipped around
the room like a boy. An encounter
like this was meat and drink to him,
and the miners good-naturedly saw to
it that he did not go hungry.</p>

<p>Somers shook his fist at the curious
little creature perched on the farthermost
cracker-barrel and slouched out
the door.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Skinner Valley did not know very
much about Hustler Joe. Six weeks
ago he had appeared at the Candria coal
mine and asked for work. Since that
time he had occupied an old shanty on
the hillside—a shanty so hopeless in its
decrepitude that it had long been
abandoned to bats and owls. Hustler
Joe, however, had accomplished wonders
in the short time he had lived
there.</p>

<p>It was a popular belief in the town
that the man never slept. Stray
wanderers by the shanty had reported
hearing the sound of the hammer and
saw at all hours of the night. Outside
the shanty loose timbers, tin cans,
rags and refuse had given way to a
spaded, raked and seeded lawn. The
cabin itself, no longer broken-roofed
and windowless, straightened its back
and held up its head as if aware of its
new surroundings.</p>

<p>This much the villagers could see;
but inside it was still a mystery, for
Hustler Joe did not seem to be hospitably
inclined, and even the children
dared not venture too near the cabin
door.</p>

<p>It was vaguely known that the man
had come over the mountains from
San Francisco, and with that the most
were content. Keen eyes and ears like
Pedler Jim’s were not common in the
community, and the little hunchback’s
welcome to the man because he came
from “Yankee-land” was not duplicated.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe had not been in the habit
of frequenting the store. His dollar
bill was in Pedler Jim’s hands a week
before the disturbed storekeeper had
an opportunity of handing back the
change. The miner had forgotten all
about the money and had wandered
into the store simply because each
stick and stone and dish and chair at
home was in its place and there was
absolutely nothing for his nervous
fingers to put in order.</p>

<p>Joe pushed open the door of the
“emporium,” then halted in evident
indecision. A dozen miners were jabbering
in half as many languages over
by the stove, huddled around it as
though the month were January instead
of June, and the stove full of
needed heat instead of last winter’s
ashes. Bill Somers lolled on the
counter, and Pedler Jim was bowing
and scraping to a well-dressed stranger
whose face Joe could not see.</p>

<p>The miner had half turned to go
when Pedler Jim’s sharp eyes fell upon
him. In another moment the hunchback
was by his side thrusting some
change into his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“You forgot it, ye know—when ye
bought them nails,” he said hurriedly;
then added, “why don’t ye come in
and set down?”</p>

<p>For a second Joe hesitated; then he
raised his head with a peculiarly
defiant up-tilting of his chin, and
strolled across the room to an unoccupied
cracker-barrel behind the gesticulating
miners. Pedler Jim went back
to his customer.</p>

<p>“You won’t find a better smoke
within fifty miles!” he said pompously,
giving the box of cigars on the counter
a suggestive push.</p>

<p>The well-dressed man gave a disagreeable
laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s hardly saying very
much, is it?” he questioned.</p>

<p>At the stranger’s first words Hustler
Joe glanced up sharply. His fingers
twitched and a gray look crept around
the corners of his mouth. The room,
the miners, and Pedler Jim seemed to
fade and change like the dissolving
pictures he used to see when a boy. A
New England village street drifted
across his vision with this well-dressed
stranger in the foreground.
He could even see a yellow-lettered
sign out one of the windows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">George L. Martin</span>,<br />
<i>Counselor at Law</i>.</p>

<p>Then it all faded into nothingness
again—all save the well-dressed
stranger in the tall black hat. In
another minute the jabbering miners,
Bill Somers, and the obsequious hunchback
were in their old places, and
Pedler Jim was saying:</p>

<p>“Jest try ’em, an’ see fur yerself.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take you at your
word,” laughed the stranger, picking
out a cigar and leisurely striking a
match. “It’s a pity you can’t have
a few more languages going in here,”
he added, throwing the dead match on
the floor and glancing at the group
around the stove. “I suppose Barrington
employs mostly foreigners in the
mines, eh?”</p>

<p>The hunchback thrust his brown
fingers through his hair and made a
wry face.</p>

<p>“Foreigners!” he exclaimed. “I was
born and raised in the state of Maine,
an’ if it wa’n’t fur Bill Somers—he’s
from York State—to talk God’s own
language to me once in awhile, I’d
’a’ gone daft long ago!”</p>

<p>The stranger chuckled softly.</p>

<p>“You hav’n’t anyone here at the
works from New England, then, I take
it, eh?” he asked, with studied carelessness.</p>

<p>A smile crept up from Pedler Jim’s
mouth and looked out of his twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, we have—” he began, then
his eyes suddenly lost their twinkle as
they encountered the despairing appeal
from beneath Hustler Joe’s slouch
hat. “We have—been wishin’ there
would be some,” he finished after the
slightest of hesitations. “We’ve got
everythin’ else under the sun!”</p>

<p>Bill Somers’s long legs came down
from the counter abruptly.</p>

<p>“Why, Jim, there’s Hustler Joe—ain’t
he from New England?”</p>

<p>The hunchback’s little beany eyes
turned upon Somers and looked him
through and through without winking.</p>

<p>“Hustler Joe came over the mountains
from San Francisco, I have heard,”
he said blandly.</p>

<p>“Oh, so he did—so he did!” murmured
Somers, and sauntered out the
door.</p>

<p>The man on the cracker-barrel over
in the corner pulled his hat down over
his eyes and sank back into the shadows.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the stranger, tossing a
bill and a small white card on the
counter, “put me up a dozen of those
cigars of yours, and there’s my card—if
you happen to know of any New
Englanders coming to these parts, just
let me know at that address, will you?
I’ll make it worth your while.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir, very good,” murmured
Pedler Jim, making a neat package
of the cigars. “Thank you, sir,”
he said suavely, holding out the change
and glancing down at the card; “thank
you, Mr.—er—Martin.” And he
bowed him out of the store.</p>

<p>One by one the miners went away;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
still the figure on the cracker-barrel
remained motionless. When the last
jabbering foreigner had passed through
the door, Hustler Joe rose and walked
across the room to the pine box where
the storekeeper was bending over his
account-book.</p>

<p>“See here, little chap,” he began
huskily, “that was a mighty good turn
you did me a bit ago—just how good it
was, I hope to God you’ll never know.
What you did it for is a mystery to me;
but you did it—and that’s enough. I
sha’n’t forget it!”</p>

<p>Something splashed down in front
of Pedler Jim, then the outer door
slammed. When the hunchback
turned to his accounts again a blot and
a blister disfigured the page before
him.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>John Barrington, the principal
owner of the Candria mine, did not
spend much of his time in Skinner
Valley. Still, such time as he did
spend there he intended to be comfortable.
Indeed, the comfort of John
Barrington—and incidentally of those
nearest and dearest to him—was the
one thing in life worth striving for in
the eyes of John Barrington himself,
and to this end all his energies were
bent.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this physical comfort,
John Barrington had built for his
occasional use a large, richly fitted
house just beyond the unpleasant
smoke and sounds of the town. A
tiny lake and a glorious view had
added so materially to its charms that
the great man’s wife and daughter had
unconsciously fallen into the way of
passing a week now and then through
the summer at The Maples, as it came
to be called in the family—“Skinner
Valley” being a name to which Miss
Ethel’s red lips did not take kindly.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrington’s factotum-in-chief
at the mines, Mark Hemenway, lived
at the house the year round. He was
a man who took every possible responsibility
from his chief’s shoulders and
was assiduous in respectful attentions
and deferential homage whenever the
ladies graced the place with their presence.</p>

<p>To Ethel this was of little consequence,
as she paid no more attention
to him than she did to the obsequious
servant behind her chair; but to Mrs.
Barrington he was the one drawback
to complete enjoyment of the place.</p>

<p>Mark Hemenway was a man of limited
means, but of unlimited ambitions.
Every day saw him more and more indispensable
to his comfort-loving employer,
and every day saw him more
and more determined to attain to his
latest desire—nothing less than the
hand of this same employer’s daughter
in marriage.</p>

<p>In a vague way Mrs. Barrington was
aware of this, though Hemenway was,
as yet, most circumspect in his actions.
Mrs. Barrington was greatly disturbed,
otherwise she would not have ventured
to remonstrate with her husband that
Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she began timidly,
“isn’t there any other—couldn’t Mr.
Hemenway live somewhere else—rather
than here?”</p>

<p>Her husband turned in his chair, and
a frown that Mrs. Barrington always
dreaded appeared between his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Now, Bess, why can’t you leave
things all comfortable as they are? I
like to have you and Ethel here first
rate, but I don’t see why you think you
must upset things when you stay only
five minutes, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t mean to upset things,
John, but—I don’t like him!” she finished
in sudden asperity.</p>

<p>“Like him! My dear, who expected
you to? Nobody supposes he is
one of your palavering, tea-drinking
members of the upper ten! He isn’t
polished, of course.”</p>

<p>“Polished! He’s polished enough,
in a way, but—I don’t like the metal
to begin with,” laughed Mrs. Barrington,
timidly essaying a joke.</p>

<p>Her husband’s frown deepened.</p>

<p>“But, Bess, don’t you see? I must
have him here—it’s easier for me, lots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
easier. Why can’t you let things be as
they are, and not bother?” he urged
in the tone of a fretful boy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrington knew the tone, and
she knew, too, the meaning of the nervous
twitching of her husband’s fingers.</p>

<p>“Well, well, John,” she said, hastily
rising, “I won’t say anything more,”
and the door closed softly behind her.</p>

<p>As she passed through the hall she
caught a glimpse of Ethel and her
friend starting for a walk, and the
strange unlikeness of the two girls
struck her anew. Just why Ethel
should have chosen Dorothy Fenno
for a week’s visit to The Maples, Mrs.
Barrington could not understand.
Perhaps it would have puzzled Ethel
herself to have given a satisfactory
reason.</p>

<p>Ethel Barrington had met Dorothy
Fenno the winter before on a committee
connected with a fashionable
charity, and had contrived to keep in
touch with the girl ever since, though
the paths of their daily lives lay wide
apart.</p>

<p>“She is mixed up with ‘settlement
work’ and ‘relief bands,’ and everything
of that sort,” Ethel had told her
mother; “but she’s wonderfully interesting
and—I like her!” she had finished
almost defiantly.</p>

<p>The girls leisurely followed a winding
path that skirted the lake and lost
itself in the woods beyond. They had
walked half an hour when they came to
the clearing that commanded the finest
view in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Ethel dropped wearily to the ground
and, with her chin resting in her hand,
watched her friend curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear girl, you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t speak to me!” interrupted
Dorothy.</p>

<p>Ethel Barrington bit her lips; then
she laughed softly and continued to
watch the absorbed face of her companion—this
time in the desired
silence. By and bye Dorothy drew a
long breath and turned to her.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it beautiful!” she murmured
reverently.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington gave a short laugh
and sat up.</p>

<p>“Yes, very beautiful, I suppose; but,
do you know, I’ve seen so much I’m
spoiled—absolutely spoiled for a scene
like that? I’d rather look at you—you
are wonderfully refreshing. I
don’t know another girl that would
have snapped me up as you did a
minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I beg your pardon,” began
Dorothy in distress.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” interrupted her friend, with
a petulant gesture; “you’ll be like all
the rest if you do.”</p>

<p>“But it was very rude,” insisted
Dorothy earnestly. “A view like this
always seems to me like a glorious
piece of music, and I want everything
quiet as I would if I were hearing a
Beethoven symphony, you know.
That is why I couldn’t bear even the
tones of your voice—but it was rude of
me, very.”</p>

<p>Ethel sighed, and fell to picking a
daisy to pieces.</p>

<p>“I used to feel that way, once,” she
said; “I did, really.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” replied
Dorothy, with a smile.</p>

<p>“But I don’t any more!”—the daisy
was tossed aside.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m like a five-year-old that’s
had too much candy, I suppose. I’ve
seen the Alps and the Rockies, the
Rhine and the St. Lawrence; and
yet, the first time I looked at that
view I felt just as you did. But
now——!”</p>

<p>“You need something outside yourself
to give zest to your life, my dear,”
said Dorothy, her eyes on the town
below.</p>

<p>Ethel looked at her narrowly.</p>

<p>“Now see here, my dear, I love you—and
you know it, but I just can’t
stand any of that settlement talk!”</p>

<p>“I never said settlement,” laughed
Dorothy, her eyes still on the straggling
cottages.</p>

<p>“I know, but—well, I just simply
can’t! How in the world you stand
those dismal sounds and sights and—and
smells,” she added, with a grimace,
“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the miners live in those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
cottages,” mused Dorothy aloud, as
though she had not heard.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” acquiesced Ethel
indifferently. “Others live over the
hill in Westmont.”</p>

<p>“They don’t look as though they’d
be very comfortable,” continued Dorothy
softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; people like that
don’t mind such things, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever ask them?”</p>

<p>Ethel looked up in quick suspicion,
but Dorothy’s face was placid.</p>

<p>“Of course not! How silly!”</p>

<p>“Suppose you do, sometimes,” suggested
Dorothy, quite as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>“I thought that was what you were
coming to!” flashed Ethel. “My dear
girl, you have no idea what those
miners are,” she continued in a superior
tone. “In the first place, I
don’t think there is one of them that
understands a word of English, and
I’d be afraid to trust my life anywhere
near them.”</p>

<p>“But the women and the little children—they
wouldn’t hurt you. Isn’t
there something you could do for them,
dear?” urged Dorothy.</p>

<p>A rumble of thunder brought the
girls to their feet before Ethel could
reply, and a big storm-cloud coming
rapidly out of the west drove the
whole thing from her mind.</p>

<p>“Quick—we must run!” she exclaimed.
“We can’t reach home,
but there’s an old shanty just behind
those trees over there. No one lives
in it, but ’twill give us a little shelter,
maybe,” and in another minute the
girls were hurrying down the hill.
Big drops of rain and a sharp gust of
wind quickened their steps to a run.</p>

<p>Had Ethel not been running with
her head bent to the wind she would
have noticed the changed appearance
of the shanty to which they were
hastening. But as it was, she rushed
blindly forward, up the steps, and
pushed open the door, Dorothy close
by her side. Once across the threshold
she stopped in amazement, while
Dorothy dropped breathlessly into the
nearest chair.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The tiny room was exquisite in its
orderly neatness. The furniture was of
the plainest, but bore an air of individuality.
On one side was a case
of books, and the mantel above the
fireplace was decorated with quaint
curios and beautiful shells.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the floor.</p>

<p>“A nearer view might the better
satisfy your curiosity, madam,” said a
voice from behind Ethel.</p>

<p>Ethel turned sharply to find herself
face to face with a man in the rough
garb of a miner. The man’s eyes
looked straight into hers without
flinching.</p>

<p>“I said that a nearer view might the
better satisfy your curiosity in regard
to my poor possessions,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yours?” she stammered, a look of
repulsion coming into her eyes.</p>

<p>The look and the shrinking gesture
were not lost on Hustler Joe. His
eyes darkened. His broad shoulders
bent in a mocking bow and his right
hand made a sweeping flourish.</p>

<p>“Mine, madam; but consider them
yours until the storm is over. I’ll not
intrude”—and he was gone.</p>

<p>A flare of lightning and a deafening
report made his exit wonderfully
dramatic to Dorothy. The rain was
falling in torrents, too—a fact which
suddenly occurred to Ethel. For a
moment she hesitated; then she sped
through the door, overtook and confronted
the miner.</p>

<p>“Go back instantly!” she commanded.
“If—if you don’t, I shall
start for home in all this rain!”</p>

<p>The words were scarcely spoken
before the man had turned and was
hurrying her back to the house. Once
inside there was an uncomfortable
silence. Dorothy came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you thought we were
unpardonably rude,” she began pleasantly.
“You see we were caught by
the shower and my friend thought no
one was living here; otherwise, we
would not have so unceremoniously
taken possession.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” murmured Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
Barrington constrainedly, going over
to the window and looking out at the
swaying trees.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe made a dissenting gesture.</p>

<p>“Say no more: you are quite welcome,”
he replied, going over to the
fireplace and touching a match to the
light wood ready placed for a fire.
“It will take the dampness out of the
air, and—of your garments,” he added,
with a furtive glance at the tall figure
in the window.</p>

<p>“Thank you, you are very kind,”
said Dorothy, drawing nearer. The
movement brought her close to the
mantel, and she picked up one of the
shells. “Did you gather these yourself?”
she asked, wondering at the
light that leaped into his eyes at the
question.</p>

<p>Ethel, turning round a minute
later, found them talking like old
friends together. She even caught
herself listening breathlessly to a
story he was telling of an Indian arrow
he held in his hand. A sudden glance
in her direction from the man’s dark
eyes sent her back to her old position
with an abruptness that surprised as
well as displeased her.</p>

<p>The storm was not a long one. The
clouds were already lifting in the west
and the rain was less flood-like in its
descent. Finally the sun peeped out
and flashed for a moment in Ethel’s
eyes.</p>

<p>Dorothy and their host were over
at the bookcase deep in a discussion of
the respective merits of Scott and
Dickens, when Ethel crossed the room
and came toward them.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, with the slightest
of inclinations in Hustler Joe’s
direction, “that the storm is over. We
can go now.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said Dorothy; then turning
to the man at her side she held out
a cordial hand. “Thank you very
much. You have been very kind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very kind—thank you,” murmured
Ethel, bowing slightly and
turning toward the door. “We shall
have to go home by the road,” she
announced regretfully a moment later,
as she stood outside looking longingly
at the hillside path where the wet
grass sparkled in the sun.</p>

<p>For a time the two girls walked on
in silence, then Dorothy murmured
softly:</p>

<p>“Not a word of English—not a
word!”</p>

<p>Ethel gave a sidelong look from her
lowered lids.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t suppose they could!”
she said petulantly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t trust my life near one
of them,” continued Dorothy in the
same low voice.</p>

<p>Ethel shrugged her shoulders and a
faint pink showed on her forehead.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she protested. “How
could you talk with him so?—what
dreadful boots he wore!”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed outright.</p>

<p>“My dear, his boots do not cover
his head. Would you have a man dig
coal in patent-leathers?”</p>

<p>Ethel made a wry face and was
silent.</p>

<p>“Seriously, dear,” Dorothy went on,
“he was very interesting to me. His
knowledge of books was most amazing.
What he is doing here I can’t imagine—he’s
no common miner!”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course not,” laughed Ethel
mockingly. “No doubt he’s a college
president in disguise! But really, I’m
not in the least interested. Let’s talk
of something else.” And she changed
the subject.</p>

<p>And yet it was Ethel who, at dinner
that night, turned to Mr. Barrington
with the abrupt question:</p>

<p>“Father, who is living in the old
shanty just beyond the Deerfield
woods?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I haven’t the least idea,
my daughter,” replied the man, mildly
indifferent.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can assist Miss Barrington
in the matter,” interposed the
smooth voice of Mark Hemenway.
“It has lately been taken in hand by a
curious creature known as ‘Hustler
Joe.’”</p>

<p>“‘Hustler Joe’?” murmured John
Barrington.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, one of the men. A queer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
silent sort—the kind that no good comes
of. I’m keeping my eye on him, however.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” observed Ethel calmly,
“I thought him quite the gentleman.”</p>

<p>The effect of her words was like
that of an electric shock around the
table; in fact, Ethel herself felt it to
some extent, for her remark was almost
as much of a surprise to herself as to
the others.</p>

<p>“Why, my daughter!” murmured
Mrs. Barrington faintly, and even
Dorothy started. There was an ugly
narrowing of Mark Hemenway’s eyes,
but it was John Barrington who spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, you seem to have the advantage,”
he drawled. “Would you mind
telling where the rest of us could meet—this
gentleman?”</p>

<p>His daughter laughed and lapsed into
her old bantering tone.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>That portion of the Candria mine
known as the “Bonanza” had been on
the black-list of the miners for some
time. It was more than two months
since Henry Rotalick, a fire boss, had
reported that an extra amount of gas
seemed to be collecting in the district.
The mine officials had begun at once to
take the utmost precautions.</p>

<p>The Bonanza was one of the wealthiest
portions of the mine, but, the coal
being deep and of very fine quality and
the slate being particularly thick, it
necessitated considerable blasting to
get down to the finest parts. Owing to
this and to the growing accumulations
of gases, the miners had for some time
past been repeatedly warned to use
the greatest care.</p>

<p>On the day after the thunderstorm,
Hustler Joe was passing through this
district when he came upon some
miners drilling holes twelve feet or
more in depth and preparing for an exceptionally
heavy charge.</p>

<p>“You’d better look out or you’ll
bring the whole thing tumbling about
your ears!” he said, with a sharp glance
at one of the men who seemed much
the worse for liquor.</p>

<p>A snarl of oaths in various tongues
followed him as he turned his back and
walked away.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later every door in
the Bonanza fell with a crash, and
solid walls of masonry three feet through
were torn down as though they were
but barriers of paper, so terrible was
the explosion that shook the earth.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe was half a mile away.
The shock threw him on his face, and
for a minute he was too dazed to think.
Then he staggered to his feet and rushed
blindly forward straight toward the
place where he thought the explosion
had occurred. At every turn he met
fleeing men, coatless, hatless and crazed
with terror. Suddenly he came face to
face with Bill Somers.</p>

<p>“Good God, man! Where ye goin’?
Are ye gone clean crazy?” demanded
Bill, clutching Joe’s arm and trying to
turn him about.</p>

<p>For answer Hustler Joe wrenched
himself free, picked up a half-unconscious
miner and set him on his feet;
then he dashed forward and attempted
to raise a fallen door that had pinned
another miner fast.</p>

<p>“Jiminy Christmas! Ye ain’t goin’
ter stay in this hell of a place alone,
anyhow,” muttered Bill, bringing his
broad shoulder and huge strength to
bear on the door. In another moment
the imprisoned man was free and in
broken English was calling on heaven
to reward his rescuers.</p>

<p>The two men did not falter for an instant,
though all the while the deadly
damp was closing around them. From
gallery to gallery they went, warning,
helping, dragging a comrade into a
possible place of safety, until human
endurance could stand it no longer.
Exhausted, they staggered into a chamber
which the fire damp had not entered.</p>

<p>“We—we’d better git out—if we’re
goin’ to,” panted Somers weakly.</p>

<p>Joe was dizzy and faint. For himself
he did not care. He had long ago
given up all thought of escape; but a
sudden vision came to him of the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
blue-eyed woman that he had so often
seen clinging to this man’s arm and
looking fondly into his face.</p>

<p>“Your wife and babies, Somers—”
murmured Joe, his hand to his head as
he tried to think. “Yes, we must get
out somehow. There’s the fanhouse—we
might try that,” he added, groping
blindly forward.</p>

<p>The fanhouse, now out of use, stood
at the top of the airshaft heading that
led up through the Deerfield hill from
the mine. And by this way the two
men finally reached the open air, and
there, blinking in the sunshine, they
sank exhausted on the hillside.</p>

<p>It was some time before Somers
found strength to move, but his companion
was up and away very soon.</p>

<p>The Candria mine had two openings
about four miles apart, that went by
the names Silver Creek and Beachmont.
The Bonanza section was a
mile and a half from the surface, and
was nearer to the Silver Creek opening
than to the Beachmont. It was to the
former entrance, therefore, that Hustler
Joe turned his steps as soon as he could
stand upon his feet.</p>

<p>The news of the disaster was before
him. Men running from the mine,
barely escaping with their lives, had
told fearful tales of crawling over the
dead bodies of their companions in
their flight. The story flew from lip
to lip and quickly spread through the
entire town. Mothers, wives, daughters,
sons and sweethearts rushed to
the mine entrances and frantically
sought for news of their dear ones.</p>

<p>When Hustler Joe reached the
Silver Creek entrance, a bit of a woman
with a tiny babe in her arms darted
from the sobbing multitude and
clutched his arm.</p>

<p>“Bill—my Bill—did you see him?”
she cried.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe’s voice shook as it had
not done that day.</p>

<p>“On Deerfield hill, by the fanhouse—he’s
all right, Mrs. Somers,”
he said huskily; and the little woman
sped with joyful feet back by the way
she had come.</p>

<p>It was Hustler Joe who was at the
head of the first rescue party that
attempted to enter the mine; but the
deadly gases increased with every
step. First one, then another of the
heroic men succumbed, until the rest
were obliged to stagger back to the
outer air, half carrying, half dragging
their unconscious companions.</p>

<p>Again and again was this repeated,
until they were forced to abandon all
hope of reaching the entombed miners
from that direction; then hasty preparations
were made to attempt the rescue
from the Beachmont opening. Here,
as at Silver Creek, Hustler Joe was
untiring—directing, helping, encouraging.
The man seemed to work in
almost a frenzy, yet every movement
counted and his hand and head were
steady.</p>

<p>Slowly, so slowly they worked their
way into the mine, fighting the damp
at every turn. By using canvas
screens to wall the side entrances and
rooms, a direct current of pure air was
forced ahead of the rescuers, and by
night their first load of maimed and
blackened forms was sent back to the
mine entrance to be cared for by
tender hands.</p>

<p>All night Hustler Joe worked, and it
was his strong arms that oftenest bore
some suffering miner to air and safety.
Once, far down a gallery, he heard a
shrill laugh. A sound so strange
brought the first tingle like fear to his
heart. Another moment and a blackened
form rushed upon him out of the
darkness, angrily brandishing a pickaxe.
Crazed with wandering for hours
in that horrid charnel-house of the
earth’s interior, the miner was ready
to kill even his rescuers. He was
quickly overpowered and his hands
and feet were securely bound; then
on Hustler Joe’s back he made the
journey of a quarter of a mile to the
cars that were waiting to bear him,
and others like him, to the aid so
sadly needed.</p>

<p>Toward morning Hustler Joe was
accosted by one of the doctors who
had been working at his side half the
night.</p>

<p>“See here, my man, you’ve done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
enough. No human being can stand
this sort of thing forever. I don’t
like the look of your eye—go outside
and get some rest. There are fifty
men now that owe their lives to you
alone. Come—you’d really better
quit, for awhile, at least.”</p>

<p>“Fifty? Fifty, did you say?” cried
the miner eagerly. Then a look came
into his face that haunted the doctor
for long days after. “Would fifty
count against—one?” he muttered as
if to himself, then fell to work with a
feverishness that laughed at the doctor’s
warning.</p>

<p>From dusk to dawn, and again from
dawn to dusk, flying ambulances,
hastily improvised from every sort of
vehicle, coursed the streets with their
gruesome burdens. Weeping throngs
surged about the Beachmont entrance
and about the stricken homes of the
dead. Sleepless wives and mothers
waited all night for news of their missing
dear ones, and peeped fearfully
through closed blinds as the dead and
injured were borne through the streets.</p>

<p>But everywhere the name of Hustler
Joe was breathed in gratitude and
love. Tales of his bravery and of his
rescues were on every lip, and when
the man walked out of the mine that
day, he walked straight into the
hearts of every man, woman and
child of the place.</p>

<p>His fellow-workmen tried to show
their love and appreciation by going
in a body to his lonely cabin on the
hillside. They found him muttering
half crazily to himself: “Fifty lives
for one—fifty for one!” And on the
table before him he had placed fifty
matches in a row and below them one
other alone.</p>

<p>They looked at him half fearfully,
wholly pitifully, thinking the past
horror had turned his brain. But he
listened with brilliant eyes and flushed
cheeks to their hearty words of thanks
and seemed strangely eager to hear all
that they had come to say.</p>

<p>Yet the next morning his eyes were
heavy with misery, and someone said
that the matches lay strewn all over
the floor where an impatient hand had
cast them—all save one, left alone
in the middle of the table.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>On the day of the explosion in the
Candria mine John Barrington sat on
the broad piazza of The Maples reading
his morning paper. Occasionally
he glanced up to admire the charming
picture his daughter and her friend
made playing tennis on the lawn nearby.</p>

<p>His night’s rest had been good and
his morning’s beefsteak tender; moreover,
a certain paragraph in the newspaper
before him had warmed his heart
and, in prospect, his pocketbook. He
leaned back in his chair and sighed
contentedly.</p>

<p>After a time he spied Hemenway’s
tall form at the far end of the winding
walk leading to the house. There was
a languid curiosity in his mind as to
why Hemenway was walking so fast;
but when he caught his first glimpse
of his general superintendent’s face,
his head came upright with a jerk, and
he waited in some apprehension for the
man to speak.</p>

<p>The girls on the lawn heard an exclamation
of dismay from the piazza,
then saw the two men pass rapidly
down the walk and disappear in the
direction of the town. Fifteen minutes
later Jennie Somers, the parlor-maid,
crossed the lawn and approached
Miss Barrington. All her pretty rose
color had fled, and her eyes were wide
and frightened.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—but would you
please let me go to town? There has
been an explosion in the mine, and my
brother—he may be hurt! May I
please go?”</p>

<p>“An explosion? How terrible!
Yes, yes, child—run right along. Don’t
hurry back if you’re needed there,”
said Miss Barrington. “I hope you’ll
find your brother uninjured,” she
added as the girl hurried away. When
she turned to speak to Dorothy she
found herself alone.</p>

<p>Miss Fenno appeared a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
later dressed in a short walking-suit.</p>

<p>“Why, Dorothy!”</p>

<p>“Has Jennie gone? If you don’t
mind, dear, I’ll go with her. I might
be able to do something,” explained
Dorothy hastily.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” shuddered Ethel, “how
can you go, dear? They’ll be all
maimed and bleeding! There’ll be
doctors and—and others to do everything
needful. I wouldn’t go—really,
dear.”</p>

<p>“I know—but there’ll be something
else to do. I might help someone—Jennie,
for instance, if she found her
brother injured. I really want to go—Oh—there
she is!” And Miss Fenno
hurried after Jennie’s swiftly moving
figure.</p>

<p>Ethel was restless when her friend
had gone. She wandered aimlessly
around the grounds, then went indoors
and began to play a waltz on the piano.
The piece was scarcely half through,
however, before her fingers moved
more and more slowly, finally straying
into a minor wail that ended abruptly
in a discordant crash as the player rose
from the piano-stool.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington’s next move was to
take the field-glass from the library and
go upstairs to the tower. From there
she could see the village and catch occasional
glimpses of hurrying forms.
She could see the Silver Creek entrance
to the mine, too, and she shuddered
at the crowds her glasses showed
her there. Twice she turned her eyes
away and started down the winding
stairs, but each time she returned to her
old position and gazed in a fascination
quite unaccountable to herself at the
moving figures in the distance.</p>

<p>By and bye she saw the head-gardener
coming rapidly up the road from
the town. As he entered the driveway
she hurried down the stairs and out into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Were there many injured, Peter?”
she asked anxiously as the man came
into the room.</p>

<p>“They don’t know yet, ma’am; they
can’t get into the mine. They’re goin’
to try the Beachmont openin’ now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they won’t find things so
bad as they think,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Mebbe not; but them that has come
out, ma’am, tell sorry tales of creepin’
over dead men’s bodies—there ain’t
much hope for the poor fellers inside
now, I’m ’fraid.”</p>

<p>“Is—is there anything one can do?”</p>

<p>Peter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not much, ma’am. They can’t
get in to get ’em out. The young lady
from the house here has got her hands
full with the women and children.
They are takin’ on awful, of course, but
she kinder calms ’em down—she and
that feller they call Hustler Joe.”</p>

<p>Miss Barrington turned away. As
she opened the door she stopped
abruptly and looked back into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“If they need anything, Peter—anything
at all—come to me at once,”
she said hurriedly, and closed the door
behind her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was at dinner the next night that
Mr. Barrington said to his general
superintendent:</p>

<p>“What was the matter with Rotalick
today? I heard you laying down
the law pretty sharp to him this noon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wanted a prima donna,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>Hemenway laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought so, too. It was simply
this. There isn’t anyone to sing
at the funerals Thursday. The choir
that usually sings at funerals hereabouts
is incapacitated through injuries
to the bass and loss of a husband
to the soprano. Rotalick wanted a
day off to go hunting for singers over in
Westmont.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” commented Mr. Barrington.</p>

<p>“I rather think our departed friends
will excuse the lack of music,” laughed
the general superintendent coarsely;
but the laugh ceased at a flash from
Miss Barrington’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you be so kind, Mr. Hemenway,
as to tell the man that I will sing
Thursday?” Once more the electric
shock ran around that table, and once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
more Mrs. Barrington murmured
faintly, “Why, my daughter!”</p>

<p>This time Mark Hemenway rose
promptly to the occasion.</p>

<p>“How very kind!” he said suavely.
“Indeed, Miss Barrington, one could
almost <i>afford</i> to die for so great an
honor. I will tell Rotalick. The
miners will be overjoyed—they have
bitterly bemoaned the probable lack
of music tomorrow. Funny they
should care so much!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know—they are human
beings, I suppose,” Miss Barrington
suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes—of course—certainly—but
then——”</p>

<p>“You seem troubled to find a solution,”
she remarked, with slightly uplifted
eyebrows; “suppose you give it
up?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I do,” he acquiesced with
ready grace, glad of the way of escape
she had opened.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Many of the victims of the explosion
had lived in Westmont, but for
those whose homes had been in Skinner
Valley a succession of funeral services
had been arranged to take place in the
Slovak Catholic Church, the largest
audience-room in the town. It was
here that Miss Barrington had offered
to sing, and as one sad service followed
another in rapid succession the task
she had undertaken was no light one.</p>

<p>But her heart did not lose its courage
nor her voice its sweetness all through
those long hours. She did grow sick
and faint, though, as the throngs of
weeping women and children filed in
and out of the church, and her voice
trembled and nearly broke when a
young girl fainted and sank to the
floor.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe had not been known to
step inside a church since he came to
Skinner Valley. On the day of the
funerals he had lapsed into his old
unapproachableness. He left his cabin
early in the morning and joined the
crowds moving toward the church,
but, once there, he lost himself in the
throngs outside instead of entering the
doors.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe had long since made up
his mind that a church was no place
for him. He had the reverence, born
of a New England boyhood’s training,
for all things sacred, and he had come
to feel that his own presence was an
unpardonable insult to any holy place.</p>

<p>The windows of the church were
open and the chanting tones of the
priest floated out to his ears. He
imagined himself as one of those still,
silent forms before the chancel, and he
bitterly envied the dead.</p>

<p>“’Twould have been the easiest way
out of it!” he muttered under his
breath. “By Jove, what a voice!” he
added aloud a moment later as the
priest’s droning gave way to the flute-like
tones of a singer.</p>

<p>“It’s old Barrington’s daughter—ain’t
she great?” said Bill Somers at
his elbow. The man had been there
several minutes furtively watching for
a chance to speak.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe did not answer until the
last note quivered into silence. Then
he drew a long breath and turned
around.</p>

<p>“Barrington’s daughter? What is she
doing here?”</p>

<p>“Singin’—didn’t ye hear her?”</p>

<p>“But why? How happens it?” Joe
demanded.</p>

<p>“Rotalick said she heard how that
the choir couldn’t sing and that the
Slavs and Poles were makin’ a terrible
touse ’cause there wa’n’t no music.
So she jest stepped up as pleasant as
ye please an’ said she’d sing for ’em.
She’s a daisy, an’ as purty as a picture.
Have ye seen her?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Hustler Joe shortly,
moving away.</p>

<p>Ethel Barrington’s singing won her
many sincere, if humble, admirers that
day, but perhaps no one inside the
building listened quite so hungrily for
every tone that fell from her lips as
did a tall, sad-eyed man who stood
outside—just beneath an open window.</p>

<p>When the last sombre procession
had moved away from the doors, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
Miss Barrington herself, white and
faint with weariness, stepped into her
carriage, Hustler Joe left his position
under the window and walked slowly
toward his home.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go back,” he muttered.
“There’s nothing but hell upon earth
to be gained by running away in this
cowardly fashion. I’ll give myself up
and take the consequences—which will
be hell somewhere else, I suppose,” he
added grimly. “Good God—it can’t
be worse than this!”</p>

<p>He pushed open his cabin door and
looked about him with troubled eyes.
For the first time he was conscious of
a fondness for the place.</p>

<p>“I’ll give them to Jim,” he said
aloud, his eyes lingering on the books
and on the shells and curios over the
mantel.</p>

<p>With feverish haste he began collecting
a few necessaries into a traveling-bag.
It was packed and strapped
when there came a knock at the door.
At so unusual an occurrence Hustler
Joe started guiltily. Then he crossed
the room and threw wide the door.</p>

<p>The bent form of an old woman with
two frightened eyes peering out from
beneath a worn shawl confronted him.</p>

<p>“Has he been here?” she whispered,
stepping into the room and glancing
furtively around her.</p>

<p>“He! Who?”</p>

<p>“Then he hasn’t, or you’d know it,”
she answered in a relieved tone; but
her expression changed almost instantly,
and her frail form shook with
terror. “But he may come! You
wouldn’t give him up—you’re Hustler
Joe, ain’t ye? They say you’re good
an’ kind. Oh, you wouldn’t give him
up!”</p>

<p>A strange look came into the miner’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t give him up,” he
said, after a moment. “But who is he?
And who are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m his mother, sir. He didn’t
know anyone was livin’ here,” she
apologized, “an’ he sent me a bit of
paper sayin’ he’d meet me here tonight.
Oh, sir, they’d hang him if they
got him! Hang him!” she shuddered.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe’s lips twitched, then
settled into stern lines.</p>

<p>“Ye see,” continued the woman,
her voice husky with feeling, “his
daddy was—was one of them that
was killed, an’ my boy came back to
look once more on his poor dead face
today. He said he’d colored his hair
an’ changed his looks so no one would
know him; but oh, they’d hang him—hang
my boy!” she finished in a
frenzy, wringing her hands and swaying
her body from side to side.</p>

<p>Through the window Hustler Joe
saw the figure of a man moving among
the shadows of the trees near the
house. The miner stepped close to
the old woman and laid a light hand
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Listen! I am going away for an
hour. When I am out of sight, go out
to the trees behind the house and call
your boy in. I shall be gone and shall
know nothing of it—you can trust me.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>A heartfelt “God bless you!” rang
in his ears as he left the house and
hurried away.</p>

<p>When he returned an hour later he
found these words scrawled on a bit
of brown wrapping-paper:</p>

<p class="blockquot">You treated me white. Thanks. You
don’t know what you saved my mother. It
would have broke her heart if they had
strung me up. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe stared fixedly at the
note long after he had read it; then he
tore the paper into tiny bits and
dropped them into the fireplace. Very
slowly he opened the traveling-bag
and unpacked one by one the articles
therein. When the bag was empty and
the room restored to its spotless order,
he drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’twould break her heart; she’s
less miserable if I stay where I am,”
he murmured. “Poor dear mother,
she’s suffered enough through me
already!”</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The days that followed were busy
ones for Ethel. Company made The
Maples gay with fun and laughter; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
Ethel did not drop her newly awakened
interest in the miners. By her earnest
persuasion Miss Fenno had agreed
to lengthen her visit, the need of these
same miners having been held up by
the wary Ethel as good and sufficient
reason for her remaining.</p>

<p>A maid, laden with the best the
house afforded, always accompanied
Dorothy on her frequent visits to the
town, and sometimes Ethel herself
went. It was after her first trip of
this sort that she burst unceremoniously
into the library.</p>

<p>“Father, do you do anything for
them?” she demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>“My dear, not being aware of the
antecedent of that pronoun, I may not
be able to give a very satisfactory
answer to your question.”</p>

<p>“What? Oh—sure enough!” laughed
Ethel. “I mean the miners, of course.”</p>

<p>“Since when—this philanthropic
spirit, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Do you, father?” persisted Ethel,
ignoring the question.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mr. Barrington began, putting
the tips of his forefingers together
impressively, “we think we do
considerable. We are not overbearing;
we force no ‘company store’ on them,
but allow that curious little Pedler
Jim full sway. We—However, have
you anything to suggest?” he suddenly
demanded in mild sarcasm.</p>

<p>Somewhat to his surprise Miss Barrington
did have something to suggest,
and that something was not particularly
to his mind. However, when Miss
Barrington set out to have her own
way she usually had it, even with her
comfort-loving father—perhaps it was
because he was a comfort-loving father
that he always succumbed in the end.</p>

<p>At all events, the Candria Mining
Company, after the explosion in the
Bonanza section, organized a system of
relief to which they ever after adhered.
The family of each miner killed in the
disaster, or dying from its effects, received
one thousand dollars cash over
and above all medical and burial expenses.
The maimed were dealt with
according to the extent of their
injuries.</p>

<p>The mine was a great source of
interest to all of Miss Barrington’s
friends, and it was accounted a great
day among them when a party under
careful escort were allowed to “do
the mines,” as they enthusiastically
termed a glimpse of the mine buildings
and a short trip through a few
underground passages.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the explosion
Ethel, with a merry party of ladies and
gentlemen led by Mark Hemenway,
and duly chaperoned, started for the
Beachmont entrance to the mine. The
general superintendent was in his
element. He explained and exhibited
all through the outer buildings, and
was about to take his charges into the
mine itself when an unavoidable something
intervened and claimed his immediate
attention. It was with evident
reluctance that he therefore
handed his party over to Bill Somers,
who, having proved himself careful
and attentive, had often before been
intrusted with the escort of sightseers
over the mines.</p>

<p>To Ethel the change was a relief.
A vague unrest had lately assailed her
whenever in Hemenway’s presence
and she had almost unconsciously begun
to avoid him. Her old indifference
to his existence had given way to a
growing realization that there was
such a being, and the realization was
bringing with it an intangible something
not quite pleasant.</p>

<p>The feminine portion of the party
followed Bill Somers through the
strange underground chambers with
daintily lifted skirts and with many
a shudder and half-smothered shriek.
And though they laughed and chatted
at times, they cast sidelong glances
of mingled curiosity and aversion at
the stalwart forms of the begrimed
miners.</p>

<p>“Is—is this anywhere near the—accident?”
asked Miss Barrington,
looking behind her fearfully.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am—oh, no!” reassured
Bill Somers quickly. “The Bonanza
is a long ways off. We don’t go
nowheres near there today, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was there an accident?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
chimed in a pretty girl with rose-pink
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Sure; this was the mine, wasn’t it?”
interposed a fussy little man with
eyeglasses through which he was peering
right and left with his small, near-sighted
eyes.</p>

<p>“Tell us about it, please,” begged
three or four voices at once; and Bill
needed no second bidding.</p>

<p>When they passed Hustler Joe,
Somers pointed him out, and as they
walked on into the next gallery he told
with unconscious power the story of
the heroic rescue of the imprisoned
men. The shifting shadows and twinkling
lights made the telling more impressive,
and the dusky forms flitting
in and out of the mysterious openings
on either side, added a realistic touch to
the tale that sobered the gay crowd
not a little. Their interest in the
earth’s interior waned perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Are—are we on the way out,
now?” asked the pretty girl, her cheeks
showing white in the gloom.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; we’re goin’ in deeper.
Wa’n’t that what ye wanted?” returned
Bill.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” murmured the
girl, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The man with glasses coughed.</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Barrington, this is
beastly air. It might be well enough
to go back before long.”</p>

<p>Bill Somers took the hint. He knew
the type to which the fussy little man
belonged. The party turned about,
and the pretty girl’s eyes flashed with a
grateful glance—a glance which the
near-sighted-glassed saw and promptly
appropriated.</p>

<p>As they repassed Hustler Joe, Ethel
Barrington dropped behind the others
and came close to the miner’s side.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you myself,” she
said, the crimson staining her cheeks
as she impulsively held out a slim, ungloved
hand. “I want to tell you how
much I appreciate your courage and
bravery at the explosion.”</p>

<p>The man flushed painfully. As he
reluctantly touched her finger-tips, she
added:</p>

<p>“You must be so happy to have
saved so many lives. I knew you were
a good man the minute I saw your
face!”</p>

<p>Hustler Joe grew white to the lips,
dropped her hand rudely and turned
away without a word.</p>

<p>Hemenway met the party at the entrance
of the mine. He was profuse
in apologies for his enforced absence
and in offerings of further service, but
Miss Barrington dismissed him with a
cool “Thank you; nothing more,” and
led the way to The Maples.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington was vexed—worse
than that, she was vexed because she
was vexed. Her pulse quickened and
her nostrils dilated as she thought of
Hustler Joe and of the way he had met
her impulsive greeting.</p>

<p>“The—the rude—boor!” she said to
herself, at loss for words to express
fittingly that to which she was so little
accustomed. A lingering touch or a
gentle pressure was the usual fare of
Miss Barrington’s graciously extended
hand—never this wordless touching of
her finger-tips and hasty, rude release.
“Not that I care,” she thought,
with a disdainful tilt of her head. “But
he might have been decently civil!”
she added, with a scornful smile as
she thought of how differently a score
of pampered youths of her acquaintance
would have received so signal a
mark of favor as she had that afternoon
bestowed on an all too unappreciative
miner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Hustler Joe had left Miss Barrington
so abruptly he had attacked
his work with a fierceness that even
the miners had never seen him show.
“A good man—a good man—‘I knew
you were a good man’!” he muttered
between his teeth. “A ‘good’ man
indeed—bah!” he snarled aloud, wielding
his pick with long, sweeping strokes.
Then he suddenly stood upright.
“Great God—am I not a good man?
Have fifty lives not a feather’s weight?”</p>

<p>The pick dropped from his relaxed
fingers, and his hands went up to his
head.</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” he moaned; “father—father—fifty,
a hundred—a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
times a hundred could not tip the scale
with your dear, dead self on the other
side!”</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Exciting days came to Skinner
Valley. Gold was discovered far up
the creek. A man furnished with
funds by Mark Hemenway, who long
had expressed faith in the locality, had
“struck it rich,” and the general superintendent
awoke one day to find himself
wealthy.</p>

<p>The effect of this awakening was
as immediate as it was startling. His
commanding tones took on an added
imperiousness, his clothing a new flashiness,
and his whole demeanor an importance
likely to impress the most
casual of beholders. His veiled attentions
to Miss Barrington gave way to a
devoted homage that was apparent to
all men, and so thick was his armor of
self-conceit that her daily snubs fell
pointless at his feet.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington had never before
spent so long a time at The Maples, and
Mr. Hemenway’s sudden accession to
wealth resulted, as far as she was concerned,
in hasty preparations to leave.
Her guests were already gone.</p>

<p>On the day before her intended departure
she started off by herself to
enjoy one more sunset from the clearing
beyond the Deerfield woods, the
place where she and Dorothy were
overtaken by that memorable thunder-shower.</p>

<p>Mark Hemenway did not confine
himself so strictly to business these
days as had heretofore been his custom,
and he was upstairs in his room when
he spied Miss Barrington’s lithe figure
disappearing in the grove that skirted
the grounds on the west.</p>

<p>The general superintendent had lately
invested in a tall silk hat, and it was
this impressive bit of headgear that he
donned as he left the house and followed,
at a discreet distance, the form
of the woman he meant to marry.</p>

<p>Since Hemenway had become rich
this idea of marriage had strengthened
wonderfully. In a certain coarse
way the man was handsome, and
the only class of women with which
he had ever come in contact had
readily welcomed his attentions. He
had supposed the lack of money would
be the only drawback in the eyes of this
his latest love, and now that the lack
no longer existed he was confident of
success.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington followed the path
very leisurely, picking a flower or a
fern here and there, and softly humming
a tune. Upon reaching the
clearing she settled herself comfortably
under her favorite tree and opened her
book to read. It was then that Hemenway
approached from the shadows
of the path she had just left.</p>

<p>At the snapping of a dry twig Miss
Barrington glanced up. Her first impulse
was to laugh, so absurd did the
checkered trousers, flaming watch-charm
and silk hat look to her against
the background of the cool green woods.
But the laugh was killed at birth by an
angry objection that the man should
be there at all. Even then she supposed
him to be merely passing by and
that he might stop for a word or two.</p>

<p>“Ah, good afternoon, Miss Barrington.
What a surprise to find you
here,” fibbed Hemenway, advancing
with easy confidence.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Hemenway.”
Miss Barrington moved her book suggestively
and lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>“Charming view you have here!”
said the man.</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“You have an interesting book
there, Miss Barrington?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I’m trying to find
out,” replied Miss Barrington, with
calm but ineffectual rudeness.</p>

<p>“Um—delightful place to read!
Nice day, too.”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemenway looked down approvingly
at the lowered lids of the
girl’s eyes and, blinded by his vast conceit,
mistook the flush of annoyance
for the blush of maidenly shyness. “I
never did like a girl to fling herself in
my face,” he mused, coming a little
nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” he said aloud, “if you have
no objections, Miss Barrington, I’ll
just stop a bit with you and enjoy this
breeze,” and he cast himself at her feet
in careful imitation of the attitude he
had seen the fussy man with glasses
assume only the week before.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington was speechless with
indignation. Her first instinct was to
spring to her feet, but the paralysis of
amazement that had struck her dumb
had also rendered her, for the moment,
incapable of motion. A sudden determination
to “teach the man a lesson
and stop once for all this insufferable
persecution”—as her mind expressed
it—followed, and she remained passively
quiet.</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence
that to any man but Hemenway would
have proved embarrassing.</p>

<p>“Er—I believe I haven’t told you,”
he finally began, “how kind I thought
it was of you to interest yourself as you
have in the miners.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary that you should,”
said Ethel icily.</p>

<p>“Very becoming modesty!” thought
Hemenway. Aloud he said: “Oh, no,
not necessary, perhaps, but I want to
do it. It is a pleasure to me.”</p>

<p>“It is not one to me.”</p>

<p>Hemenway frowned. There was
such a thing as carrying this modesty
too far.</p>

<p>“Your singing, too—it was delightful!”
he continued smoothly. “And
so kind of you to do it!”</p>

<p>Miss Barrington turned a leaf of her
book with an unnecessary rustling of
the paper.</p>

<p>“Feigning indifference,” commented
Hemenway to himself. “I’ve seen ’em
do that before.”</p>

<p>“You looked so tired that night after
the funerals. I actually worried about
you—you looked sick,” he said next, in
what was meant for tender tones.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington’s eyes narrowed
ominously as she replied:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemenway, my actions and my
looks can have no possible interest
for you. I should be obliged if you
would cease to consider them.”</p>

<p>To Hemenway’s perverted fancy
this was but a bit of shy bait. He
promptly took advantage of it.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I have the very
greatest interest, my dear Miss Barrington—the
very warmest interest. I—I—Miss
Barrington, as you may be
aware, I am a rich man now.”</p>

<p>“That does not concern me in the
least,” retorted Ethel sharply.</p>

<p>A strange expression came over
Hemenway’s face. For the first time
a doubt shook his egotistical content.
His eyes grew hard. No maidenly
shyness prompted that speech. Still—possibly
she had not understood.</p>

<p>“Miss Barrington, it has long been
in my mind to ask you to be my wife.
I love you, and now I am rich I am
confident I can make you——”</p>

<p>“Stop! I won’t even listen to you!”
Miss Barrington was on her feet, her
eyes blazing.</p>

<p>Hemenway rose and faced her. All
his polish dropped like a mask, and the
real man looked out from beneath
angrily frowning brows.</p>

<p>“You won’t listen, my fine lady?
And why not, pray? Ain’t I good
enough to speak to you?”</p>

<p>“I hate you—I despise you—oh, I
loathe the very sight of you!” shuddered
Ethel, losing all control of herself.
“Now will you leave me in peace—or
must I say more before you quite
understand me?”</p>

<p>Hate—despise—loathe; these words
Hemenway knew. The delicate shafts
of society sarcasm fell powerless
against his shield of self-conceit, but
these heavier darts struck home and
reached a vital point—his pride. His
face grew livid.</p>

<p>“Will you go?” repeated Ethel impatiently,
not a quiver of fear in the
scorn of her eyes—“or shall I?” she
added.</p>

<p>“Neither one!” he retorted insolently.</p>

<p>For answer Ethel wheeled and took
two steps toward the path. Hemenway
was at her side in an instant with
a clutch on her wrist that hurt her.</p>

<p>“Coward!” she cried. “Would you
force me to scream for protection?”</p>

<p>“Do so, if you like—there’s not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
house within earshot, and the inhabitants
of this region are not given to
walking for pleasure!” He released
her wrist and stepped again in front of
her.</p>

<p>The sharp throb of terror that paled
Ethel’s cheek was followed by one of
joy that sent the color back in surging
waves—Hustler Joe’s shanty just behind
those trees! It was after six—he
must be there. If worst came to
worst——!</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemenway, this is altogether
too theatrical. I ask you again—will
you let me pass?”</p>

<p>“If you think I am a man to be
loathed and hated and despised with
impunity, young lady, you are much
mistaken. No, I won’t let you pass—you’ll
listen to me. I want none of
your airs!” he finished sourly.</p>

<p>Ethel’s head bent in a scornful bow.</p>

<p>“Very well, suppose we walk on,
then,” she said. “I’m tired of standing.”
And she turned about and began
walking in the opposite direction from
the path that led toward home.</p>

<p>Mark Hemenway was suspicious of
this sudden acquiescence. He hurried
to her side and looked sharply into
her face.</p>

<p>“None of your tricks, young lady!
I mean business,” he snarled. “If
you ain’t willing to hear what I’ve got
to say by fair means, you shall by
foul!” he added, bringing a small revolver
into view, then slipping it back
into his pocket.</p>

<p>Ethel was thoroughly frightened.
She thought Hemenway must be mad.</p>

<p>“I should think you had stepped
out of a dime novel, Mr. Hemenway,”
she began, trying to steady her shaking
lips. “Nobody wins a bride at
the point of a pistol nowadays!” The
trees that hid Hustler Joe’s shanty
from view were very near now.</p>

<p>“Then you needn’t treat me as if I
was nothing but the dirt under your
feet,” he muttered sullenly, already
regretting his absurd threat of a moment
before.</p>

<p>Ethel suddenly darted forward and
around the edge of the trees, ran across
the lawn and sprang up the steps of
the shanty. Hemenway was close at
her heels when she flung the door open
with a bang and stood face to face with
Hustler Joe.</p>

<p>“Will you please take me home?”
she asked, trying to speak as though
she considered it a customary thing
to invade a man’s house and demand
his escort in this unceremonious fashion.
“Mr. Hemenway is—busy and
cannot go,” she added, with a cheerful
assurance due to the presence of the
big-bodied miner at her side.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe instantly accepted the
part she had given him to play.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to be of any service,”
he said respectfully, with ready
tact, but with a sharp glance at
Hemenway.</p>

<p>The general superintendent bowed
to Miss Barrington with uplifted hat,
then turned and walked away.</p>

<p>“Please do not ask me any questions,”
said Miss Barrington hurriedly
to Hustler Joe as they left the house.
“You had better take me by the path
through the woods—it is the nearer
way, and will be less embarrassing
than the main road would be for—both
of us. I know you think my
conduct extraordinary, but, believe
me, I had good reason for asking your
escort. You—you always seem to be
around when I need someone!” she
concluded, with an hysterical little
laugh—the tension to which she had
been keyed was beginning to tell on
her.</p>

<p>“No apology is needed,” demurred
the man gravely. “I think I understand.”</p>

<p>That walk was a strange one. The
sun had set and the woods were full
of shadows, and of sounds unheard in
the daytime. Ethel was faint and
nervous. The miner was silent. Once
or twice Ethel spoke perfunctorily.
His answers were civil but short.
At the edge of the private grounds the
girl paused.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much; I shall not
forget your courtesy,” she said, hesitating
a moment, then resolutely
offering her hand.</p>

<p>It was not the finger-tips the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
touched this time—it was the hand
from nail to wrist; and his clasp quite
hurt her with its fierceness.</p>

<p>“Miss Barrington, you thought me
a brute the other day when you spoke
so kindly to me, and no wonder. I
can only beg your pardon—your words
cut deep. I am going to the mines
tomorrow—the gold mines, I mean.
I’m glad I had this chance to speak to
you. You were wrong, Miss Barrington—I—I’m
not the good man you
think!” He dropped her hand and
turned away.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe it!” she called
softly, and fled, swift-footed, across
the lawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mark Hemenway did not appear at
The Maples that night. A message
from him received by Mr. Barrington
in the evening said that he had been
suddenly called away on business connected
with his gold mine; that he
would return soon, however, and would
like immediately to make arrangements
whereby he could sever his
connection with the Candria Mining
Company, as his new interests needed
all his attention.</p>

<p>“Humph!” commented Mr. Barrington.
“I never saw a little money
make such a dam fool of a man as it
has of Hemenway!”</p>

<p>Ethel’s lips parted, then closed with
sudden determination. Twelve hours
later she left for Dalton without mentioning
to her father her experience
of the day before, and within a week
she had sailed from New York on a
steamer bound for Liverpool.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>The discovery of gold had made all
the miners at Skinner Valley restless,
and Hustler Joe was among the first
to take his wages and start for the
promised bonanza.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe of the coal mines was
still “Hustler Joe” of the gold mines.
The same ceaseless, untiring energy
spurred the man on to constant labor.
The claim he staked out proved to be
the richest in the place and wealth
sought him out and knocked at his
cabin door.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Hustler Joe was
surprised. He had come to the mines
simply because they promised excitement
and change. He had thought,
too, that possibly they harbored the
peace and forgetfulness for which he so
longed.</p>

<p>But peace had fled at his approach
and wealth had come unasked. Man-like,
he regarded the unsought with
indifference and gazed only at the
unattainable; whereupon wealth rustled
her golden garments to charm
his ears and flashed her bright beauty
to dazzle his eyes. Still failing to win
his heart, she whispered that she—even
she—was peace in disguise, and
that he had but to embrace her to find
what he sought.</p>

<p>It was then that Hustler Joe yielded.
In a year he had sold half his claim
for a fabulous sum. The other half he
retained, and leaving it to be developed
under the charge of expert engineers,
he left for Skinner Valley.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe had never forgotten the
little hunchback pedler, nor the debt
of gratitude he owed him. Many a
time in the old days at the coal mines
he had tried to pay this debt, but
always, in his own estimation, he had
failed. So it was of Pedler Jim that
he first thought when this new power
of wealth came into his hands.</p>

<p>The news of Hustler Joe’s good luck
had not reached Skinner Valley, and
the man was in the same rough miner’s
garb when he pushed open the familiar
door of the “Emporium” in search of
Pedler Jim.</p>

<p>“Well, if it ain’t Hustler Joe!” exclaimed
the hunchback delightedly.
“You’re a sight good fur sore eyes.
Come back ter stay?”</p>

<p>“Well, awhile, maybe. How’s the
world using you these days, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fair—fair; ’tain’t quite ’s good
as I’d like—but I ain’t complainin’.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if anything would make
you complain—I never heard you,”
remarked Joe, helping himself to a
seat on the counter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Well, now that ye mention it,
mebbe I don’t much—I hain’t no need
to. My appetite’s good an’ my conscience
is clear; an’ a clear conscience
is——”</p>

<p>“Jim,” interrupted the miner
sharply, “did you ever hear of Aladdin
and his lamp?”</p>

<p>“Huh? Oh, the feller that rubbed
it an’ got what he wanted?”</p>

<p>“That’s the chap.”</p>

<p>“Well—s’posin’ I have?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I only wondered what you’d
ask for if you had one to rub.”</p>

<p>“Gorry—I wish’t I had!”</p>

<p>“Well, what would you?” persisted
Joe, his face alight.</p>

<p>“What would I? Well, I’ll tell ye.
I’d buy the big house on the hill——”</p>

<p>“What—Barrington’s?” interrupted
Joe.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, no! I mean the empty
one that Rotalick lived in; an’ I’d
make it over into a hospital, an’ I’d
add to it as I was able.”</p>

<p>“A hospital? Why, there is one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know—the company’s; but
the boys always have ter quit there
long ’fore they’re able. They can’t
work, an’ if they laze ’round home it
takes furever to git well—what with
the noise an’ the children an’ all. They
crawl down here to the store, an’ my
heart jest aches fur ’em, they’re so
peaked-lookin’. I’d have it all fixed
up with trees an’ posies an’ places
ter set, ye know, where they could
take some comfort while they was
gittin’ well.”</p>

<p>A moisture came into Joe’s eyes.</p>

<p>“But how about yourself?” he
asked. “You haven’t rubbed out
anything for yourself, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Fur me? Gorry—if I jest had that
lamp, you’d see me rubbin’ out somethin’
fur me, all right. I’ve been wantin’
ter send home a box ter the old folks—’way
back in Maine, ye know. Jiminy
Christmas, man, there’d be no end ter
the black silk dresses and gold-headed
canes an’ fixin’s an’ fur-belows that I’d
rub out an’ send to ’em!”</p>

<p>Hustler Joe laughed; then something
came into his throat and choked
the laugh back.</p>

<p>“But all this isn’t for you, Jim,” he
remonstrated.</p>

<p>“Huh? Not fur me? Fur heaven’s
sake, man, who is it fur, then?”</p>

<p>The miner laughed again and slid
off the counter.</p>

<p>“You’ve got quite a store, Jim.
Ever wish you had more room?” he
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Pedler Jim not only nibbled at the
bait, but swallowed it.</p>

<p>“Well, ye see, I’m goin’ ter have
the place next door when I git money
enough and then I’ll jine ’em together.
That’ll be somethin’ worth while,” he
continued.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe easily kept him talking
on this fascinating theme a full ten
minutes, then he prepared to take his
leave.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” he mused aloud, “you
came from Maine, you say. About
where—the town, I mean?”</p>

<p>Jim named it.</p>

<p>“You say the old folks are living
there yet?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded.</p>

<p>“Name is Powers, I suppose, same
as yours; maybe you were named for
your father, eh?”</p>

<p>“No; father’s name was Ebenezer, an’
mother objected—so it’s ‘Jim’ I am.
Why? Goin’ ter dig up my family tree
by the roots?” asked the little man
whimsically.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” laughed the miner,
looking strangely embarrassed as he
hurried out the door.</p>

<p>“Monte Cristo” had been Hustler
Joe’s favorite tale in his boyhood
days. He thought of it now, as he left
the “Emporium,” and the thought
brought a smile to his lips.</p>

<p>A few days later Pedler Jim was
dumfounded to receive a call from a
Westmont lawyer.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend,” the man began,
“I have a few little documents here
that demand your attention.”</p>

<p>Pedler Jim eyed the formidable-looking
papers with some apprehension.</p>

<p>“Now see here, sir,” he demurred,
“my conscience is perfectly clear. I
don’t want nothin’ to do with sech
devilish-lookin’ things as that!”—his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
eyes on the big red seal. “I hain’t
never harmed no one—’tain’t an arres’,
is it?” he added, his voice suddenly
failing him.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly!” returned the lawyer,
chuckling to himself. “This, my
friend, is the deed, filled out in your
name, to the Rotalick property on the
hill back here; and this,” he continued,
taking up another paper and
paying no attention to the little hunchback,
who had dropped in limp stupefaction
on to a packing-box, “this is
the deed—also made out in your
name—to the building adjoining this
store on the south. Mr. Balch, the
present occupant, has a lease which
expires in two months. After that the
property is at your disposal.”</p>

<p>“But where in thunder did I git it?”
demanded Pedler Jim.</p>

<p>“That is not my business, sir,”
said the lawyer, with a bow.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” murmured
the hunchback, gingerly picking up one
of the deeds and peering at it.</p>

<p>Pedler Jim was still further astounded
to find that to his tiny bank
account had been added a sum so
large that he scarcely believed his eyes.
It was entered under the name “Hospital
Fund.”</p>

<p>Following close upon all this came
a letter from the folks at home:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Dear Jimmie</i>: What a good, good son
we have, and how can we ever thank you!
(“Dear Jimmie” looked blank.) The black
silk, so soft and rich, will make up into such
a beautiful gown—much too fine for your
old mother, Jimmie, but I shall be proud of
it. Father is already quite puffed up with
his lovely gold-topped cane. Nellie and
Mary and Tom and John have divided up
the pretty ribbons and books and sweetmeats
to suit themselves, as long as you
didn’t single them out by name. (“No—I’m
blest if I did!” murmured Jim.) We were
proud and pleased to get the box, Jimmie,
both because the things were so beautiful
and because you thought to send them.
(“I’ll be hanged if I did!” muttered the
hunchback, scratching his head in his perplexity.)
Why don’t you come on East
and see us, dear? We wish you would.</p>

<p>Then followed bits of neighborhood
gossip and family news, ending with
another burst of thanks which left
Pedler Jim helpless with bewilderment.</p>

<p>It was that night that Somers was
talking in the store.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s rich—rich as mud, they
say, an’ I ain’t sorry, neither. There
ain’t anyone I know that I’d as soon
would have a streak o’ luck as Hustler
Joe.”</p>

<p>Pedler Jim was across the room, but
he heard.</p>

<p>“Rich! Hustler Joe rich!” he demanded,
springing to his feet.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is!”</p>

<p>“Jiminy Christmas!” shouted the
hunchback. “I’ve found him—he was
the lamp himself!”</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>It was in Dalton, the nearest large
city to Skinner Valley, that Hustler
Joe began his career as a rich man.</p>

<p>He built him a house—a house so
rare and costly that people came from
miles around to stare and wonder.
Society not only opened its doors to
him, but reached out persuasive hands
and displayed its most alluring charms.
She demanded but one thing—a new
name: “Hustler Joe” could scarcely
be tolerated in the aristocratic drawing-rooms
of the inner circle! He gave
her “Westbrook,” and thenceforth
“Mr. Joseph Westbrook” was a power
in the city.</p>

<p>He was petted by maneuvering
mamas, flattered by doting papas, and
beamed upon by aspiring daughters;
yet the firm lips seldom relaxed in a
smile, and his groom told of long night
rides when the master would come
home in the gray of the morning with
his horse covered with mud and foam.
But society cared not. Society loves a
Mystery—if the Mystery be rich.</p>

<p>When Joseph Westbrook’s mansion
was finished and furnished from cellar
to garret and placed in the hands of a
dignified, black-robed housekeeper at
the head of a corps of servants, and
when his stables were filled with
thoroughbreds and equipped with all
things needful, from a gold-tipped whip
to a liveried coachman, Mr. Joseph
Westbrook himself was as restless and ill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
at ease as Hustler Joe had been in the
renovated shanty on the hillside.</p>

<p>The balls and the dinners—invitations
to which poured in upon him—he
attended in much the same spirit that
Hustler Joe had displayed in loitering
in Pedler Jim’s “Emporium”—anywhere
to get rid of himself. But if the
inner man was the same, the outer certainly
was not; and the well-groomed
gentleman of leisure bore little resemblance
to the miner of a year before.</p>

<p>On the night of the Charity Ball
Westbrook had been almost rude in
his evasion of various unwelcome advances,
and he now stood in the solitude
for which he had striven, watching
the dancers with sombre eyes. Suddenly
his face lighted up; but the flame
that leaped to his eyes was instantly
quenched by the look of indifference he
threw into his countenance. Coming
toward him was Ethel Barrington, leaning
on the arm of her father.</p>

<p>“Mr. Westbrook,” said the old gentleman
genially, “my little girl says
she is sure she has seen your face somewhere,
so I have brought her over to
renew old acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Someone spoke to John Barrington
then, and he turned aside, while Westbrook
found himself once more clasping
a slim firm hand, and looking into
a well-remembered pair of blue eyes.</p>

<p>“You are——?”</p>

<p>“Hustler Joe,” he supplied quietly,
his eyes never leaving her face.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” she exclaimed, her pleasure
frankly shown. “I never could
forget your face,” she added impulsively,
then colored in confusion as she
realized the force of her words.</p>

<p>But his tactful reply put her immediately
at ease and they were soon
chatting merrily together, closely
watched by many curious eyes. Society
never had seen Mr. Joseph Westbrook
in just this mood before.</p>

<p>“Father did not recognize you,” said
Ethel, after a time.</p>

<p>“No; I was introduced to Mr. Barrington
at the Essex Club a week ago.
I hardly thought he would remember
Hustler Joe. You have just returned,
Miss Barrington?”</p>

<p>“A month ago—from Europe, I
mean; mother is there yet. America
looks wonderfully good to me—I have
been away from it the greater part of
the last two years, you know. When I
came home to Dalton I found the name
of Mr. Joseph Westbrook on every lip.
You seem to be a very important personage,
sir,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“A little gilding goes a long way,
sometimes,” he replied, with a bitter
smile.</p>

<p>“But there must have been something
to gild!” she challenged. “Mr.
Westbrook, for the last two weeks I
have been at The Maples—have you
been down to Skinner Valley lately?”
she asked, with peculiar abruptness.</p>

<p>“Not for some months.”</p>

<p>“There are some changes in the village.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“That poor little deformed storekeeper
has bought the Rotalick house
and has turned it into the dearest little
convalescents’ home imaginable.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” murmured Westbrook,
meeting Miss Barrington’s gaze with a
face that was innocently noncommittal.
“Pedler Jim always was kind to the
boys.”</p>

<p>“So it would seem; still—someone
must have helped him in this,” she
suggested, her eyes on his again.</p>

<p>“Do you think so? Possibly! I am
wondering, Miss Barrington, if we
might not find it cooler over there by
the window. Will you allow me to
escort you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we might,” she smilingly
assented. “Perhaps we could find
some subject of conversation other
than Hustler Joe’s generosity to Pedler
Jim, too—we might try!” She threw
him a merry glance, which he answered
with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Barrington, you quite
overestimate anything I may have had
to do in the matter. It was entirely
Pedler Jim’s idea. How about the
reading-room?” he suddenly asked,
mentioning Miss Barrington’s latest
gift to the miners, “and the kindergarten
class, and the——”</p>

<p>“Ah—please!” interrupted the girl,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
with hand upraised in laughing protest.
“I acknowledge myself vanquished
at my own game. I’ll talk
about—the weather, now, if you like,”
she finished dutifully.</p>

<p>Westbrook laughed, but before he
could reply Miss Barrington was claimed
by a tall young fellow for the next
dance.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he mused as he saw
them glide gracefully into the waltz—“I
wonder if dancing belongs to those
things one never forgets. I’ll have
to brush up my old steps—and learn
some new ones,” he added, after a
pause.</p>

<p>From the night of the Charity Ball
the world appeared in new colors for
Westbrook. He did not stop to question
the cause of all this change. If
wealth were lifting her disguise and
showing a glimpse of peace, he was too
rejoiced to care to ask the reason.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d come up to the house
some time,” said John Barrington to
Westbrook one evening soon after the
Charity Ball. “I’d like to talk with
you—we can’t make any headway in
this infernal racket!”—the “infernal
racket” in question being the high C’s
and low G’s of some world-famous
singers at a particularly exclusive
musical.</p>

<p>Westbrook smiled.</p>

<p>“Thank you; I should be only too
happy.”</p>

<p>“Then call it tomorrow night—to
dinner. Seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I will—and thank you,” said
Westbrook after a momentary hesitation.</p>

<p>To his daughter John Barrington
said a little later:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve invited Mr. Westbrook up
to dinner tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Westbrook!”</p>

<p>“Why, yes—why not? You seem
surprised.”</p>

<p>“Gilding does count, doesn’t it,
father dear?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Gilding? My dear, I don’t
know what you mean. I know he’s
rich as mud—if that’s what you’re
talking about; but he’s got more than
money—he’s got brains. He knows as
much about mines as I do! I like him—he’s
worth a dozen of the youths that
usually flutter about you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is,” laughed Ethel, the
color in her cheeks deepening.</p>

<p>That was but the first of many visits.
Barrington was urgent, Ethel charmingly
cordial—and Westbrook, nothing
loth.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>“I’m in search of a good lawyer,”
said Westbrook to John Barrington
one day. “Can you recommend one
to me?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I can. I have in mind the
very man—he’s been doing a little
work for me, and he is very highly
spoken of.”</p>

<p>“That sounds about O. K. Who is
he?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the point,” laughed the
older man; “the name’s escaped me.
He’s from the East—hasn’t been here
very long. I’ll tell you what—I’ll
bring him into your office tomorrow.
Will that do?”</p>

<p>“It will—and thank you.”</p>

<p>Westbrook’s “office” was something
new. A life of leisure was becoming
wearisome; consequently he invested
in various bits of real estate, opened an
office, put a man in charge, and of late
had himself tended strictly to business,
such time as he could spare from his
social engagements.</p>

<p>It was into this office that Mr. Barrington
came one morning accompanied
by a short, smooth-faced man
whose garments were irreproachable in
style and cut.</p>

<p>“Ah, Westbrook,” began Barrington,
“let me introduce Mr. Martin, of
Martin &amp; Gray, the lawyer of whom I
was telling you yesterday.”</p>

<p>Again the room and all it contained—save
the figure of Martin himself—faded
from Westbrook’s sight, and he
saw the New England street with the
lawyer’s sign in the foreground. The
next moment the vision was gone, and
he had extended a cordial hand.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to meet Mr. Martin,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
he said, looking the lawyer straight in
the eye.</p>

<p>“Mr. Westbrook—delighted, I’m
sure,” murmured the little man suavely;
then, in a puzzled tone, “have I
had the honor of meeting you before,
Mr. Westbrook? There is something
familiar about you.”</p>

<p>“Is there?” began Westbrook, but
John Barrington interrupted.</p>

<p>“There, Martin, you’ve hit my case
exactly! He’s puzzled me a thousand
times with a little turn or twist that’s
like someone I’ve seen. Dash it—who
is it?”</p>

<p>“My features must be cast in a common
mold,” laughed Westbrook, “to
remind so many of one they know.”</p>

<p>“Um—ah—well—I shouldn’t want
to say quite that!” retorted Barrington.
“Well, gentlemen,” he resumed
after a pause, “I’ll leave you to your
own devices. I’m off—good morning.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, and thank you,”
replied Westbrook, rising. “I’ve no
doubt Mr. Martin will prove a credit
to your introduction,” he concluded
as he bowed the elder gentleman out.
Then he turned to the lawyer and began
the business at hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his own room that night Westbrook
carried a small mirror close to
the light and scrutinized himself for
some minutes.</p>

<p>“H’m,” he mused, “hair rather gray
for a man not yet thirty; still—it looks
less like that of a youth of twenty.”</p>

<p>He stroked his carefully trimmed
beard meditatively.</p>

<p>“Hides the telltale mouth and chin
pretty well,” he murmured. “Mr. Joseph
Westbrook can stay where he is
for the present, I think.”</p>

<p>The next evening Westbrook called
at the Barringtons’. He found Ethel
and Mr. Martin at the piano singing a
duet which they continued at his solicitation.
Then the two musicians
drifted into a discussion of Martin’s
favorite composer, which was like a
foreign language to Westbrook.</p>

<p>After a half-hour of this the lawyer
took his leave. Westbrook drew a long
breath, but it was caught and stifled
in half completion by Miss Barrington’s
first remark.</p>

<p>“What a fine voice he has!”</p>

<p>“Er—yes, very.”</p>

<p>“And his knowledge of musical matters
is most unusual, too.”</p>

<p>“That so?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He says he wanted to make
music his profession, but his parents
objected; so he took up law.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” murmured Westbrook
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he talks of musicians as
glibly as though he had read Grove as
much as Blackstone. I haven’t had so
good a time discussing my pet composers
for many a day.”</p>

<p>Westbrook stirred restlessly, and his
hostess suddenly became aware of the
hopelessly lost look in his eyes. She
promptly changed the subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the very next day that Mr.
Joseph Westbrook appeared in the
leading book-store of the city.</p>

<p>“I want some lives of musicians,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon?”</p>

<p>“Books, I mean—lives of musicians.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, of course,” apologized
the clerk. “Which ones?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—the best ones, to be
sure.” Westbrook’s voice faltered at
first, but it vibrated with the courage
of his convictions at the last.</p>

<p>The clerk suddenly turned his back,
and when Westbrook next saw his face
it was an apoplectic shade of reddish
purple.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. Bach, Beethoven,
Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Mozart,
Chopin——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, put me up one of each,”
interrupted Westbrook hastily; he was
growing suspicious of the clerk. He
left the store with more dignity than
he usually displayed.</p>

<p>The real estate business would have
suffered in the next few days had it
depended entirely upon Westbrook, for
the greater share of his time was spent
in poring over the recent addition to
his library. At the end of a month he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
was sadly entangled in a bewildering
maze of fugues, sonatas, concertos and
symphonies, in which the names of
Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, Handel,
Mendelssohn, Mozart and Chopin were
hopelessly lost.</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Westbrook often met the lawyer
at the Barringtons’ after that first visit.
Martin’s music and Martin’s voice
seemed to be unfailing attractions in
the eyes of Miss Barrington. Westbrook
studied his “lives” assiduously,
but only once did he venture to take
any part in the discussions of composers
which were so frequent between
Miss Barrington and the lawyer. That
once was sufficient to show him how
hopeless was the task he had set for
himself; and ever after he kept a discreet
silence on the subject of music
and all that pertained thereto.</p>

<p>As the winter passed, Westbrook was
seen more and more frequently in the
company of Miss Barrington. His eye
had lost its gloom and his step had
gained a new springiness. Just why,
Westbrook did not stop to consider.
Indeed, the considering of anything
was what the man most wished to avoid.</p>

<p>It was on a beautiful morning in
May that he asked Miss Barrington to
drive with him. The air that brushed
his cheek was laden with the fragrance
of green-growing things, and the girl
at his side had never seemed so altogether
lovely. He let the reins loosen
in his hands as he settled back for an
hour of unalloyed enjoyment.</p>

<p>“I am particularly glad to take this
drive today,” remarked Miss Barrington,
smiling into his eyes, “for, as I
go away tomorrow, I may not have
another opportunity of enjoying one
at present.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Westbrook, suddenly
sitting upright.</p>

<p>“I merely said I was going away
tomorrow,” she returned merrily,
picking out with intuitive skill that
portion of her remark which had so
startled him. Then something in his
face made her add—“for the summer,
you know.”</p>

<p>Westbrook pulled the reins taut and
snapped the whip sharply. Going
away! Of course; why not? What of
it? Yes, what of it, indeed! Long
days fraught with sudden emptiness
loomed up before him and stretched
on into weeks devoid of charm. He
understood it all now—and he a felon!
He could hear a girl’s voice saying,
“I knew you were a good man the
minute I saw your face!” Unconsciously
he shrank into the corner of
the carriage, and was only brought to
a realization of his action by a voice—amused,
yet slightly piqued—saying:</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Westbrook, I hardly
expected so simple a statement would
render you speechless!”</p>

<p>“Speechless? No, oh, no—certainly
not! I beg your pardon, I’m sure,”
he said, talking very fast. “You’re
going away, you tell me. It is needless
to assure you that we shall all
miss you very much. Where do you
go, if I may ask—and how long are
you to remain?” And he turned to
her with eyes so full of misery that
she could scarcely believe she had
heard his words aright.</p>

<p>Before she could answer there came
the wild, irregular clattering of unguided
horses’ feet. Westbrook turned
quickly to see two frightened animals
rushing toward them dragging a swaying
empty carriage. By a swift and
skilful turn he just escaped the collision,
but Ethel Barrington felt the
hot breath of the beasts as they flew
past. In another moment their own
startled horse had dashed after the
runaways with speed scarcely less
than their own.</p>

<p>Westbrook brought all his great
strength to bear, then—the right rein
snapped. The horse swerved sharply,
throwing the man to his knees. The
next moment he was crawling cautiously,
but rapidly, over the dashboard
on to the thill, then to the back
of the frightened animal, where he
could grasp the dangling broken reins.
One strong pull, and the horse stopped
so suddenly that the man shot over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
her head to the ground; but he did not
relax his hold, and the trembling
animal stood conquered.</p>

<p>Westbrook turned to look into the
shining eyes of the girl, who had leaped
from the carriage and come close to his
side.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was wonderful! But—my
God! I thought you’d be killed,”
she cried, holding out two trembling
hands, then sinking to the ground and
sobbing out her nervousness and
relief.</p>

<p>The man looked down at her with
yearningly tender eyes. Involuntarily
he extended his hand as though to
caress the bowed head; but he drew
back shuddering—that hand had forfeited
all right to such a touch. The
look in her eyes had thrilled him to his
finger-tips, but it as quickly stabbed
him with the revelation that not he
alone would suffer.</p>

<p>“Miss Barrington, don’t, I beg of
you,” he said finally, in a voice that
was stem with self-control. “You are
completely unnerved—and no wonder.”
Then he continued more gently, “But
see—Firefly is quiet now. Will you dare
to drive home behind her if I can
manage somehow to mend the reins?”</p>

<p>A vivid color flamed into the girl’s
cheeks and she rose unsteadily to her
feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” she asserted, forcing
her trembling lips to speak firmly.
“I am ashamed of myself. I hope you
will pay no attention to my babyishness,
Mr. Westbrook.”</p>

<p>“You were not babyish, Miss Barrington,”
objected Westbrook gravely;
“on the contrary you were very brave.”
But as he helped her into the carriage
he averted his eyes and refused to meet
her questioning gaze.</p>

<p>All the way home Ethel Barrington
talked with a nervous volubility quite
unlike herself. Westbrook made an
effort to meet her brilliant sallies with
something like an adequate return, but
after two or three dismal failures he
gave it up and lapsed into a gloomy
silence broken only by an occasional
short reply.</p>

<p>“I expect my friends will come this
evening to say good-bye—I shall see
you, shall I not?” she asked gaily as
she gave him her hand in alighting at
her own door.</p>

<p>Before Westbrook fully realized what
the question was, he had murmured,
“Yes, certainly”; but when he drove
away he was muttering, “Fool, what
possible good can it be to you now?
Just suppose she knew you for what
you are?”</p>

<p>Ethel entered her door and slowly
climbed the stairs to her room.</p>

<p>“He cares; I know he does!” she
exclaimed under her breath. “But
why—why couldn’t he—?” Then the
conscious red, that was yet half in
pique, flamed into her cheeks and she
shrugged her shoulders disdainfully.</p>

<p>When Westbrook called that night
she gave him a gracious hand and
looked frankly into his eyes with the
inward determination to “have no
more nonsense”; but her eyelids
quickly fell before his level gaze and
she felt the telltale color burning in
her cheeks. She was relieved when her
father broke the awkward silence.</p>

<p>“Well, Westbrook, we shall miss
you—we’ve got so we depend upon
seeing you about once in so often.
We shall be in Skinner Valley in
August. You must plan to run down
to The Maples then and make us a
visit. I should like to show you the
mines.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Westbrook,
glancing toward the door and, for the
first time in his life, welcoming the
appearance of Martin.</p>

<p>Martin advanced, smilingly sure of
his welcome, nor did he notice that
Miss Barrington’s greeting was a shade
less cordial than usual. His coming
was the signal for an adjournment to
the music-room, and there Westbrook
sat with clouded eyes and unheeding
ears while the air about him rang with
melody. After a time he was conscious
that the music had stopped and
that Ethel was speaking.</p>

<p>“I think I never heard of anything
so horrible!” she said.</p>

<p>From Martin’s next words Westbrook
gathered that they were talking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
of a particularly atrocious murder that
had been committed in the city the
night before. Then the girl spoke
again, her voice vibrating with feeling.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Mr. Martin—only think of
a human being fiendish enough to attack
his own son!”</p>

<p>Westbrook tried to rouse himself, to
speak, to move; but he seemed bound
by invisible cords. His head was
turned away from the speakers, but he
saw their reflection in the mirror facing
him, and he noticed that the lawyer’s
gaze was fixed across the room upon
himself with a peculiar intentness as
he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, incredible, I grant, Miss Barrington;
and yet, in a little New England
town of my acquaintance a boy
of twenty shot down his own father
in cold blood at their own fireside.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Mr. Martin—the human
fiend!” shuddered Ethel.</p>

<p>The lawyer’s eyes did not waver; a
strange light was coming into them.</p>

<p>“A human fiend, indeed,” he repeated
softly, half rising from his chair.</p>

<p>Something seemed to snap in Westbrook’s
brain, and he forced himself to
his feet.</p>

<p>“Your music set me to day-dreaming,”
he began, with a smile as he
crossed the room, “and your creepy
murder stories awoke me to a realization
that the sweet sounds had stopped.
Come”—he looked straight into Martin’s
eyes—“some time you may tell
me more of this gruesome tale—I am
interested in studies of human nature.
No doubt you meet with many strange
experiences in your business; but now
I want you to sing ‘Calvary’ for me.
Will you, please? Then I must go.”</p>

<p>Martin rose to his feet with a puzzled
frown on his face and picked up a
sheet of music from the piano.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Westbrook, when
the song was finished. Then he turned
to Ethel with extended hand. “I hope
you will have a pleasant summer,” he
said in stilted politeness.</p>

<p>“You are very kind. Shall I wish
you the same?”</p>

<p>Her voice and her fingers were icy.
Her pride was touched, and she expressed
no hope as to their future meeting,
and certainly Westbrook dared not.
He left the house with a heart that was
bitterly rebellious, and the blackness
outside seemed to him symbolical of
his own despair.</p>

<p>That night, and for long nights afterward,
he rode over the hills outside the
city. Little by little his life dropped
back into the old rut. All the new
warmth and brightness faded with the
going of Miss Barrington, and he threw
himself into business with a zeal that
quickly brought “Westbrook &amp; Company”
into the front rank and filled
his purse with yet greater wealth—wealth
which he had come to hate, and
for which he had no use.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>One morning, long after sunrise,
Westbrook entered the outskirts of the
city and allowed his tired beast to slow
to a walk. In one of the poorest streets
of the tenement district he saw a white-faced
woman, a group of half a dozen
puny children and a forlorn heap of
clothing and furniture. He was off his
horse in a moment, and a few kindly
questions brought out the information
that they had been evicted for arrears
in rent amounting to thirty dollars because
the woman had been too ill to
work. He straightway paid the sleek
little agent not only the amount due,
but also a year’s rent in advance and
rode away, followed by a volley of
thanks and blessings from the woman.
He did not know that Martin was the
landlord and that he came out of the
tenement in time to hear the details of
the incident fresh from his agent.</p>

<p>As Westbrook turned the corner of
the dingy street a curious elation took
possession of him. How the sun shone—how
exhilarating the air was! How
his heart beat in tune with it all!
What was this new joy that seemed
almost to choke and suffocate him?
Was this the shadow of peace at
last?</p>

<p>He threw the reins to the groom
with so beaming a smile that the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
scratched his head meditatively for a
full half-minute.</p>

<p>“Faith, an’ what’s got into the master?”
he muttered as he led the horse
to the stable.</p>

<p>In the days that followed society
was treated to a new sensation—the
Mystery turned into a Philanthropist.
A school, a library and a hospital were
under way in a wonderfully short time.
Did Westbrook hear of anyone wanting
anything—from a toy to a piano
or a dinner to an education—he
promptly bought and presented it.
The result was disastrous. There came
a constant stream of beggars to his
door, varying from those in rags asking
a nickel to bank presidents demanding
a million—for “investment,” of course;
furthermore, he was obliged to hire two
private secretaries to attend to his
mail.</p>

<p>In August came a cordial note from
Mr. Barrington inviting him to The
Maples for a two weeks’ visit. The
stiffly worded refusal which Westbrook
despatched by return mail threw John
Barrington into a state of puzzled dissatisfaction,
and John Barrington’s
daughter into a feeling of unreasoning
anger against the world in general and
Joseph Westbrook in particular. The
anger was not less when, two months
later, Westbrook called on the Barringtons
just four weeks after they had
come up to their town residence in
Dalton.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant call. Westbrook
was stilted, Mr. Barrington
plainly ill at ease, and Ethel the personification
of chill politeness; yet she
became cordiality itself when Martin
appeared a little later. She chatted
and laughed with the lawyer and sent
merry shafts of wit across the room to
Westbrook and her father. But when
Westbrook had gone she lapsed into
bored indifference and monosyllables.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrington was called from the
room after a time, leaving his daughter
and Martin alone. The lawyer broached
subject after subject with unvarying
ill success, even music itself failing to
awaken more than a passing interest.
At last he said abruptly:</p>

<p>“Queer chap—that Westbrook!”</p>

<p>“Queer? Why?” almost snapped
Miss Barrington.</p>

<p>Martin raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“How can you ask?” he returned.
“You’ve seen him—you know him!”</p>

<p>Miss Barrington gave the lawyer a
swift glance. Just what did he mean?
Had he noticed the change in Westbrook’s
manner—his indifference—his
coldness? Did he think that she——?</p>

<p>Miss Barrington laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes, Mr. Martin, I do know
him—slightly, perhaps; but ‘queer’ is
not the adjective I would have applied
to him.”</p>

<p>The lawyer leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Miss Barrington, <i>what</i> do you know
of him? Did it ever occur to you how
very little any of us know of this man?”</p>

<p>The lady stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Martin, I know him for
a gentleman, as you do—I might also
add that he is quite a noted philanthropist,
of late,” she added teasingly.</p>

<p>“‘Philanthropist!’” scorned the lawyer.</p>

<p>Miss Barrington’s manner instantly
changed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Westbrook is doing a world of
good with his money; I admire him for
it,” she said with decision.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” returned the man
smoothly. “Still, I wonder why—this
sudden generosity!”</p>

<p>“Sudden? It’s a long time since I
first heard of Mr. Westbrook’s good
deeds, Mr. Martin,” replied Miss Barrington,
a vision of Pedler Jim and his
hospital rising before her eyes.</p>

<p>“H’m-m,” murmured the lawyer,
his level gaze on her face, “you knew
him before, perhaps—this man they—er—call
‘Westbrook.’”</p>

<p>The lady sprang to her feet and
crossed the room to the piano.</p>

<p>“Oh, fie, Mr. Lawyer!” she laughed
nervously. “I’m no poor victim on
the witness stand. Come—let’s try
this duet.”</p>

<p>The man followed her and leaned his
elbow on the piano, but he did not
pick up the music nor take his eyes from
her face.</p>

<p>“You have known him before, then—under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
his other name, of course,” he
hazarded.</p>

<p>A swift red came into Ethel’s
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Perhaps—perhaps not! I really
do not care to discuss it.” And she
wheeled around upon the piano-stool
and dashed into the prelude of the
duet.</p>

<p>Martin waited until her hands
glided into the soft ripple of the accompaniment.</p>

<p>“Then you, of all people, Miss Barrington,”
he began again, “should
know that this philanthropic mummery
is nothing but a salve for his
conscience. Admirable, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>The music stopped with a crash.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded.
“I don’t know what you
are talking about, with your miserable
innuendoes.”</p>

<p>Martin’s face paled.</p>

<p>“Innuendoes!” he burst out, losing
his temper; “then I’ll speak plainly,
since you demand it! Since when,
Miss Barrington, have you made a
practice of shielding—murderers?”</p>

<p>He regretted the word the instant it
had left his lips, but he forced himself
to meet Miss Barrington’s horrified
gaze unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“Murderer!” she gasped. “Hustler
Joe was no murderer!”</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Barrington re-entered
the room and Martin turned to
him in relief. Five minutes later he
had made his adieus and left the
house.</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Murderer!</p>

<p>Ethel fled to her room and locked
the door, but the word laughed at bolts
and bars. It looked from the walls and
the pictures and peeped at her from the
pages of the book she tried to read.
She opened the window and gazed up
at the stars, but they, too, knew the
hated word and spelled it out in
twinkling points of light.</p>

<p>Murderer?</p>

<p>Ah, no, it could not be—and yet——</p>

<p>Away back in Ethel’s memory was a
picture of the Deerfield woods that
skirted the lawn at The Maples. She
saw the tall, grave-faced miner and the
imperious girl, and even now the words
rang in her ears—“I’m not the good
man you think, Miss Barrington!”
Half-forgotten tales of “Hustler Joe’s
queerness” came to her, too, and
assumed an appearance of evil.</p>

<p>And was this to be the explanation
of that ride—that ride on which she
had almost betrayed herself only to be
met by stern words of conventionality?
Was this the meaning of the infrequent
calls, the averted face, the eyes so
misery-laden if by chance they met
her own?</p>

<p>A murderer?</p>

<p>Ah, no, no! He was so good—so
kind—so brave! There were Pedler
Jim, the miners whose lives he had
saved, and the multitudes of the city’s
poor to give the lie to so base a charge;
and yet—Martin had said that these
very benefactions were but a lullaby to
a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>The night brought Ethel no relief.
The dark was peopled with horrid
shapes; and sleep, when it came, was
dream-haunted and unrefreshing. In
the morning, weary and heavy-eyed,
she awoke to a day of restless wandering
from room to room. Twenty-four
hours later her trunk was packed and
she was on her way to The Maples.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that Westbrook’s
philanthropy took a new turn.
He began to spend long hours in the
city prison while society looked on and
shrugged disdainful shoulders. The
striped-garbed creatures behind the
bars seemed to possess a peculiar
fascination for him. He haunted their
habitation daily, yet he never failed
to shudder at every clang of the iron
doors.</p>

<p>Particularly was he kind to those
outcasts from human sympathy—the
murderers. So far did he carry this
branch of his charity that the authorities
ventured to remonstrate with the great
man one day, telling him that he was
putting a premium on the horrible
crime. They never forgot the look
that came over the beneficent Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
Joseph Westbrook’s face as he turned
and walked away.</p>

<p>It was on that night that the servants
said he sat up until morning in his
library, raging around the room like
some mad creature, so that they were
all afraid, and one came and listened at
the door. There he heard his master
cry out:</p>

<p>“My God—is it not enough? Is
there no atonement—no peace?” Then
there was a long, quivering sigh, and a
noise as of a clinched hand striking the
desk, and a low muttered, “Oh, the
pitiless God of Justice!”</p>

<p>In the morning Westbrook left the
house before breakfast and boarded
the eight o’clock train for Skinner
Valley.</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Westbrook had gone back to Skinner
Valley for a talk with Pedler Joe,
having it in his mind to tell the little
hunchback his life story as that of a
friend of his and so get the benefit
of sound advice without quite
betraying his secret. But the door
opened suddenly and Bill Somers burst
into the store.</p>

<p>“There’s another blow-up at the
mine!” he gasped thickly. “An’ the
old man’s daughter—she——”</p>

<p>“What old man’s daughter?” demanded
Westbrook, his lips white.</p>

<p>“She—Barrington’s girl—is down
there in that hell! She went in with
her friends at two o’clock. They——”</p>

<p>“Which entrance?” thundered Westbrook,
with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>“Beachmont! They——”</p>

<p>Westbrook dashed down the steps
and across the sidewalk, whipped out
his knife and cut loose a horse from
the shafts of a wagon in front of the
store. The next moment he had
mounted the animal and was urging
it into a mad run toward the Beachmont
entrance of the Candria mine.</p>

<p>Again did he face a crowd of weeping
women and children crazed with
terror; but this time there stood
among them the bowed form of the
great mine-king himself. John Barrington’s
lips were stern and set, and
only his eyes spoke as he grasped
Westbrook’s hand.</p>

<p>Once more did a band of heroic men
work their way bit by bit into the
mine, fighting the damp at every turn
under Westbrook’s directions.</p>

<p>Barrington had looked at the preparations
in amazement.</p>

<p>“How comes it that this Westbrook,
this millionaire, knows the mine so
well?” he stammered.</p>

<p>A woman standing near—Bill Somers’s
wife—answered him.</p>

<p>“That’s Hustler Joe, sir,” she said
softly.</p>

<p>Hustler Joe! John Barrington drew
a deep breath as the memories of the
Bonanza catastrophe came to him.</p>

<p>“Thank God for Hustler Joe!” he
breathed fervently. “If anyone can
save my little girl, ’tis he!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, sir—an’ he’ll do it,
too,” returned the little woman, her
eyes full of unshed tears.</p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Slowly, so slowly, the rescuers
worked their way into the mine. One
by one the unconscious forms of the
miners were borne back to fresh air
and safety. But no trace could be
found of Miss Barrington and her band
of sightseers.</p>

<p>At last, far down a gallery, Westbrook
heard a faint cry. With an answering
shout of reassurance he
dashed ahead of the others and came
face to face with Ethel Barrington.</p>

<p>“You!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; you’re not hurt?”</p>

<p>She shook her head and leaned
heavily against the wall. The reaction
was making her head swim.</p>

<p>“And your friends?”</p>

<p>“Here”—she pointed to the ground
almost at her feet. “They’re not hurt—they
fainted.”</p>

<p>Stalwart miners poured into the
narrow chamber and lifted the prostrate
forms, leaving Westbrook to follow
with Miss Barrington. That young
lady still leaned against the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“I—we should be going; can you—let
me help you,” stammered Westbrook.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can walk,” she laughed
nervously, making a vain attempt to
steady her limbs as she moved slowly
away from her support.</p>

<p>Westbrook caught her outstretched
hand and passed his disengaged arm
around her waist.</p>

<p>“Miss Barrington, you’re quite unnerved,”
he said, his voice suddenly
firm. “Pardon me, but you must accept
my assistance.” And he half carried,
half led her down the long gallery,
at the end of which they could hear
the steps and voices of their companions.</p>

<p>All the misery of the last few days
fled from Ethel’s mind. She was conscious
only of the strength and bravery
and tenderness of the man at her
side. Martin’s hated words became as
phantoms of a past existence.</p>

<p>“You—you haven’t told me how
you came to be here today, Mr. Westbrook,”
she began again, a little
hysterically. “I thought you were in
Dalton.”</p>

<p>“I came down this morning,” he
said. Then added softly, “Thank God!”</p>

<p>Ethel was silent for a moment.
When she spoke again her voice
shook.</p>

<p>“As usual, Mr. Westbrook—you are
near when I need you! If I am ever
in danger again, I shall promptly look
for you. Now see that you do not
disappoint me!” she added with assumed
playfulness, trying to hide her
depth of feeling.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the turn
when a distant rumble and vibrating
crash shook the walls about them,
throwing Westbrook and Miss Barrington
to the ground. It was some
time before the man could stagger to
his feet and help his companion to
stand upright.</p>

<p>“What—what was it?” she gasped.</p>

<p>Westbrook advanced two steps only
to come sharply against a wall of
earth and timbers.</p>

<p>“My God—the roof is fallen!” he
cried.</p>

<p>She came close to his side.</p>

<p>“Then there was another explosion?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But they will find us?”</p>

<p>“That wall may be—” he stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Many feet in thickness, I know,”
she supplied.</p>

<p>“And the damp—if it should enter
the gallery from the rear—” his voice
choked into silence.</p>

<p>“I know—I understand. But—we
are together!” She laid her hand on
his arm.</p>

<p>He caught the hand and held it in
both his own, then slowly raised it and
laid the soft palm against his lips.</p>

<p>“Ethel—Ethel—may God forgive
me!” he whispered brokenly.</p>

<p>She swayed dizzily, and he caught
and held her close.</p>

<p>“I—I think I am going to faint,”
she murmured. “I——”</p>

<p>His arms tightened their clasp and
her head drooped until it lay in the
hollow of his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ethel, darling—only one little
word! Ah, sweetheart—I’ve loved you
so!”</p>

<p>She raised her hand and just
touched his cheek with her fingers,
then let her arm fall about his neck.
His head bent low and his lips closed
over hers as she drew a long, quivering
sigh.</p>

<p>“May God forgive me,” he breathed,
“but ’tis the end—the end!”</p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>When Ethel Barrington regained
consciousness she was in her own bed
at The Maples, but it was a full two
days after that before they let her ask
the questions that so often came to her
lips. It was her father who finally answered
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, you were unconscious
when the miners found you. Westbrook
could barely speak. Why,
girlie, when that second crash came
and the miners realized that Hustler
Joe—as they insist upon calling that
remarkable man—was himself imprisoned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
they swarmed into that mine
like ants and attacked the fallen wall
like madmen! Those that had no
pickaxe clawed at the dirt and stones
with their naked fingers.”</p>

<p>“And—Mr. Westbrook?”</p>

<p>“Is all right and has been here every
day to inquire for you and to bring
you these,” replied Mr. Barrington,
with a wave of his hand toward the
sumptuous red roses on the table.</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes lingered on the flowers
and her cheeks suddenly glowed
with a reflection of their vivid color.</p>

<p>“He is very kind,” she murmured
as she turned her face away.</p>

<p>For a week Westbrook and his roses
made daily calls. At the end of that
time it was reported to him that Miss
Barrington was feeling quite like herself.
The next morning Westbrook
did not appear, but his roses came in
charge of a boy together with a note
for Miss Barrington.</p>

<p>The missive bore no date, no salutation,
but plunged at once into its
message.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That I should address you at all is an insult,
but my cowardly weakness when we
were last together makes it a greater insult
for me to keep silence now. I have waited
until you were quite recovered before giving
you this, for I know that it will give you
pain—and that it <i>will</i> give you pain is at
once my greatest curse and my greatest joy.
That I should have dared to love you is
despicable, but that I should have allowed
you to give me even one tender thought
in return is dastardly—and yet, nothing in
heaven or hell can take from me the ecstasy
of that one moment when your dear lips
met mine!</p>

<p>Forgive me—think kindly of me if you
can, for—God help me—I am going away,
never to look on your face again. I was
a boy of twenty when I committed the sin
against God and man that has made my
life a thing of horror. For years I have
sought for peace; adventure, work, wealth,
philanthropy—each alike has failed to bring
it. I am going now to my boyhood’s home
to receive my just punishment.</p>

<p>Ah, Ethel, Ethel, my lost love—what can
I say to you? I have but words—words—empty
words! I can see the horror in your
dear eyes. I am not worthy of even the
thought of you, and yet, my darling, oh,
my darling, were it not for this dread shadow
on my life, I swear I would win you for
my darling in very truth!</p>

<p>But now—God help me—farewell!</p>

</div>

<p>There was no name signed, but this
Ethel did not notice until she had read
the note three times with her tear-dimmed
eyes; then she whispered:</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! He could not sign
‘Westbrook’ and he would not sign—the
other.”</p>

<p>Much to John Barrington’s amazement,
his daughter insisted upon going
to town on the noon train that day.
In response to his persistent objections
she assured him that she felt
“perfectly well and quite equal to a
journey around the world, if necessary.”</p>

<p>At four o’clock Lawyer Martin was
surprised by an urgent note summoning
him to the Barringtons’ Dalton residence
on Howard Avenue. Half an
hour afterward he was ushered into
the presence of Miss Barrington herself.</p>

<p>The interview was short, sharp and
straight to the point. A few hours
later Miss Barrington and her maid
boarded the eight o’clock express for
the East.</p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>Twenty-four hours passed after
Westbrook had sent his letter to Miss
Barrington before he could so arrange
his affairs as to start for the little New
England village of his boyhood. All
day and all night he had worked with
feverish haste, and the time had flown
on wings of the wind; now, when he
was at last on the morning “Limited,”
the hours seemed to drag as though
weighted with lead.</p>

<p>He could see it all—the proud new
name he had made for himself dragged
low in the dust. He knew just how society
would wonder and surmise; just
how the maneuvering mamas would
shake their skirts in virtuous indignation
and how the doting papas would
nod their heads in congratulation over
a miraculous escape.</p>

<p>He knew how the poor and friendless
in the great city would first deny
the charge, then weep over the truth.
He knew, too, the look that would
come to the faces of the miners, and he
winced at even the thought of this—Hustler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
Joe had prized his place in the
hearts of his miner friends.</p>

<p>There was one on whom he dared not
let his thoughts rest for a moment; yet
it was that one’s face which seemed
ever before his eyes, and it was that
one’s voice which constantly rang in
his ears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again the sun had set and it was
twilight in the little New England village.
The street had not changed
much—the houses were grayer and the
trees taller, perhaps.</p>

<p>As he neared the familiar gate, he
saw in the window the face of a silver-haired
woman. Was that his mother—his
dearly beloved mother of long ago?
She turned her head and he was answered.</p>

<p>After all, would it not be better to
pass on and away again, rather than
to bow that gray head once more in
grief and shame?</p>

<p>His steps lagged and he almost
passed the gate. Then he drew a long
breath, turned sharply, strode up the
path and pulled the bell.</p>

<p>The sweet-faced woman opened the
door. The man’s dry lips parted, but
no sound came, for from an inner room
advanced Ethel Barrington with a
gray-haired man whose kindly face
wore a strangely familiar smile.</p>

<p>“What is it, wife? Is it—Paul?” he
asked in tremulous tones.</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>

<p>It was long hours afterward that
Paul Joseph Weston sat with Ethel
alone in the library.</p>

<p>“But yourself, dear—you have not
told me yet how you came to be here,”
he said.</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Rash boy! Was there not need of
someone’s preparing your father and
mother for so wonderful a home-coming?
I found out by judicious inquiry
that you had not yet left the city, so I
knew, when I took the train, that I
had at least a few hours’ start of
you.”</p>

<p>“But how—what—how could you,
dear? Surely I didn’t tell——”</p>

<p>Again she laughed, but this time she
dimpled into a rosy blush.</p>

<p>“When your very disquieting letter
came, sir, I remembered something Mr.
Martin had once said to me. I went
to town, sent for Mr. Martin and insisted
upon his telling me all that he
knew of—your youth.”</p>

<p>“And that was?”</p>

<p>“That he believed you to be Paul
Weston, who had quarreled with his
father and run away after apparently
killing the poor gentleman. Mr. Martin
said that the father did not die,
but slowly recovered from his wound
and made every possible effort to find
his son, even sending Martin himself
to seek for him. Once Martin traced
the boy to a mining camp, but there
he lost the trail and never regained it
until he thought he saw Paul Weston’s
features in Joseph Westbrook’s face.”</p>

<p>“Ethel, what did Martin first tell
you of me that caused you to go to him
for aid?”</p>

<p>“He hinted that you were a—ah,
don’t make me say it, please!”</p>

<p>The man’s face grew stern.</p>

<p>“And he knew all the time it was
false!” he cried.</p>

<p>She put a soft finger on his tense
lips.</p>

<p>“We just won’t think of him—and
really, I’ve forgiven him long ago, for
it was he that helped me in the end,
you know. Besides, he acknowledged
that he didn’t really suppose you were
Paul Weston. I—I fancy he didn’t
want me to think too highly of this
interesting Mr. Joseph Westbrook!” she
added saucily.</p>

<p>The arm that held her tightened its
clasp.</p>

<p>“He needn’t have worried,” she continued,
with uptilted chin. “I shall
never, never marry Mr. Joseph Westbrook!”</p>

<p>“Ethel!”</p>

<p>“But if Hustler Joe or Paul Weston
should ask——”</p>

<p>Her lips were silenced by a kiss and
a fervent, “You little fraud of a sweetheart!”</p>

<a name="The_Constitution" id="The_Constitution">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Constitution</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY FREDERICK UPHAM ADAMS<br />
<i>Author of “The Kidnapped Millionaires,” “Colonel Monroe’s Doctrine,” “President
John Smith,” “Shades of the Fathers,” etc.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE practical man values a house
not by its antiquity, but by
its conformability to modern
standards of construction and equipment.
If he purchases an ancient
structure he is not required to pay
an added price because of its lack of
plumbing, its absence of gas and electric
lighting fixtures, and he is not entranced
that its roof leaks and that its
cellar is damp and moldy.</p>

<p>This same man, if he gives the subject
a passing thought, will likely assure
you that the Constitution of the United
States is a perfect document because
it is more than one hundred years old.
It also is likely that this is the extent
of his information concerning that
famous document.</p>

<p>The average lack of knowledge concerning
our National Constitution is
astounding. Like children who have
been drilled to repeat the Lord’s Prayer
without the faintest conception of what
the petition means, we have mentally
drilled ourselves to believe that our
Constitution is perfect, that it was inspired
by a superhuman wisdom, and
that it is treason to criticize or even
discuss its infallible precepts.</p>

<p>In this respect we are the most narrow,
bigoted and prejudiced people who
pretend to keep in alignment with
progress. For more than one hundred
years we have been proclaiming the
perfection of our free governmental institutions,
and calling on other nations
to admire us and to follow our example.</p>

<p>Within the past few years the truth
has been forced home on us that the
officialdom of our townships, villages,
cities, counties, states and of the nation
is maggoty with corruption; that our
local, state and national legislatures
are openly controlled by mercenary
private interests; that the scandals concerning
our judiciary can no longer be
smothered or concealed; that our citizens
are powerless to pass laws demanded
by the majority, or to defeat
those aimed to despoil the majority;
that the burdens of taxation are
spurned by those who have amassed
wealth by means of unfair and ofttimes
purchased legislation, and that the
domination of corporations and vested
interests is so complete as to be apparent
to the dullest of the plundered.</p>

<p>This language is not exaggerated.
It is impossible to overstate the enormity
of the depth to which we have descended
in the scale of political morals.
Ten years ago any one of the disclosures
which now are made from week to
week would have aroused the nation;
today the repetition of these horrors
dazes those who attempt to keep track
of them. Not one crime in a hundred
ever sees the light in printer’s ink.
The bigger thieves are so buttressed and
protected by the fortifications of
wealth, and so secure behind the barbed
wire entanglements woven by the
courts, that their enraged dupes cannot
reach them.</p>

<p>Great Britain is a republic in all save
name, yet no such conditions prevail
under its government. France is a republic,
yet its people are not despoiled
by official brigands, neither is the free
expression of its electorate crushed beneath
the massed weight of its moneyed
interests.</p>

<p>I count it a disgrace to be an American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
so long as these degrading conditions
prevail. It is a dishonor to live
in a city, community, state or nation
where thievery is condoned or tolerated,
and it is cowardly weakness for the
honest majority to assume that the
problem of corruption is past their
solving.</p>

<p>The most formidable barrier in the
way of permanent redress has been
erected and is maintained by those
who are checked by it. It consists of
the absurd assumption that our material
prosperity has been the consequence
of the perfect provisions of our
National Constitution. It is manifested
in the senseless worship of the
forefathers, and the ignorant deification
of the founders of the document,
which for more than a hundred years
has served as a model for our state,
municipal and local governments.</p>

<p>We have come to recognize the
hopelessness of honest majorities when
pitted against the machinery of our
municipal governments; we no longer
deny that the cumbersome machinery
of our state governments lends itself
to the manipulation of corrupt private
interests; the suspicion has dawned on
us that our National Congress is more
concerned with thwarting public sentiment
than in conforming to it; and despite
all this knowledge we steadfastly
refuse to direct our gaze to the prime
cause of these abuses.</p>

<p>With a hundred monopolies filching
from us that which we have created—and
doing it under the guise of law and
by sanction of the Constitution; with
legislatures, executives and courts
scorning to put into operation those
remedies for which we have legally
voted—and declining to do so under
the authority of the Constitution; with
a system of taxation which places all
the burdens on those who are poor because
they are producers of wealth, and
releasing from taxation those who have
become rich because of their exploitation
of labor and through the debauching
of its representatives—this system
being founded on constitutional decisions—we
yet cling to the childish
delusion that ours is the only perfect
government ever bequeathed to mankind.</p>

<p>Compared with the governments of
England and France we have only the
semblance of self-rule, while they possess
the substance. The people of
Germany have more direct influence
over legislation than have those of the
United States. Despite an autocratic
emperor, surrounded as he is by a
nobility and protected by the most
powerful standing army in the world,
the people of Germany have made
greater progress along the road of
democracy within the last twenty
years than we have.</p>

<p>If in England there is valid reason
to believe that the majority of the
people hold an opinion counter to that
of the administration in power, Parliament
is dissolved and a direct appeal
is made to the voters for a new body
of representatives. The new Parliament
meets and proceeds to pass the
laws demanded by the electorate. There
is a House of Lords, but it does not
dare reject a measure known to be
popular. There is a king, but he has
not exercised his veto power for more
than a century and a half, and one
need not be a prophet to hazard that
he never will exercise it again. There
is no supreme court in England. In
that benighted monarchy when the
people pass a law it is a law, and not a
guess.</p>

<p>To all intents and purposes the same
procedure obtains in France and in a
score of other countries which might
be named. Ours is the only country on
earth where the vote of a citizen has
no direct significance.</p>

<p>We are not permitted to vote for a
President, but are allowed to help
choose electors who represent not us,
but the state. There is no such thing
as a citizen of the United States, so
far as the franchise is concerned. If
you have a vote it is by grace of the
state in which you reside. The Constitution
does not recognize your
individual sovereignty in any way.
If you doubt this assertion read that
document.</p>

<p>The state fixes your qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
as a voter. It might debar you because
of your sex, because of your
height, because you were not worth
$100,000, and you would have no
redress under the Constitution of the
United States. Possibly you did not
know this.</p>

<p>In practice you are privileged to vote
for members of the Lower House of
Congress. That is the beginning and
the end of your influence so far as
your national government is concerned.
You have nothing to do with the
selection of senators, and I doubt if
you are consulted as to the composition
of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>As I have explained, if the Lower
House of the Legislature in England
passes a law, it at once becomes a law.
Under our Constitution the Senate has
the power to amend or defeat it. This
is supposed by us to be the quintessence
of all earthly legislative wisdom.
This is Check Number One on
the mandate of the foolish people. In
passing, I desire to repeat that this is
the only alleged republic or constitutional
monarchy yet remaining on
earth which assumes that its majorities
are unfit to influence legislation.</p>

<p>If the measure demanded by the
people be so fortunate as to pass the
House and Senate, the President may
veto it. This is Check Number Two on
the mandate of the foolish people. If
the President sign the measure the
Supreme Court may declare it unconstitutional,
and that is the end of it,
unless a subsequent infallible Supreme
Court should overrule the decision
of the first infallible Supreme
Court. This is Check Number Three
on the mandate of a free and enlightened
people. In the event that
the Supreme Court should decide that
a law is a law, the financial interests
adversely affected may and do defeat
its enforcement by legal quibbles as to
details, or may and do resort to the
bribery of the officials charged with
the execution of the law. These are
Checks Numbers Four and Five on the
will of the people in this, the one
perfect system of popular government
ever designed in all history.</p>

<p>We are the most corrupt nation on
earth because of “our peculiar form
of Government”; because of the exactions
and limitations of a Constitution
which was designed to protect and conserve
the interests of property rather
than of citizenship. Those who are
astounded or offended at this statement
need only read the record of the
convention which drafted the Constitution
in order to satisfy themselves
as to its moderation. I do not mean
to insinuate that the fifty-five delegates
who met in Philadelphia in 1787
had any idea of establishing a system
which would foster corruption, but
the records absolutely prove that they
deliberately planned to suppress the
rule of the majority in order that popular
clamor might not menace property
interests. The train of abuses from
which we now suffer flow logically from
the checks they then provided; checks
which place selfish and corrupt wealth
beyond the reach of public redress.</p>

<p>Those foolish persons who have been
taught in school and in the public
prints that the founders of our Constitution
were sincerely desirous of
establishing a system of government
in which the will of the people should
find free expression, will be shocked
and undeceived when they read its
debates and proceedings as recorded
by James Madison, one of the delegates
from Virginia. When one comes
to learn of these fifty-five delegates
that not more than ten are on record
as voicing the slightest degree of confidence
in the wisdom of the people or
their fitness to rule, he is likely to take
a new view of the Constitution framed
by them, and he is able to account for
the innumerable ills which we are
compelled to suffer.</p>

<p>I will quote a few expressions of
opinion from delegates who wielded the
greater influence in the construction
of the Constitution:</p>

<p><i>Roger Sherman</i>—“The people should
have as little to do as may be about the
Government.”</p>

<p><i>Elbridge Gerry</i>—“The evils we experience
flow from an excess of democracy,
the worst of all possible evils.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p><i>John Dickinson</i>—“A limited monarchy
is one of the best governments
in the world.”</p>

<p><i>Rufus King</i>—“It is immaterial to
the people by what government they
are possessed, provided they be well
employed.”</p>

<p><i>Alexander Hamilton</i>—“The British
monarchy is the best government in
the world,” and he doubted if anything
short of it would do in America.
“Their House of Lords is a most noble
institution.”</p>

<p><i>Alexander Hamilton</i>—He acknowledged
himself not to think favorably
of republican government. “Inequality
in property constitutes the great
and fundamental distinction in society.”</p>

<p><i>Gunning Bedford</i>—“Are we to act
with greater purity than the rest of
mankind? Our votes are actuated by
interest and ambition.”</p>

<p><i>Gouverneur Morris</i>—“The Senate
must have great personal property; it
must have the aristocratic spirit; it
must love to lord it through pride. To
make it independent it should be for
life. Property is the main object of
society.”</p>

<p><i>John Rutledge</i>—“Property certainly
is the principal object of society.”</p>

<p><i>Pierce Butler</i>—“Slaves should have
an equal representation in a government
which is instituted principally for
the protection of property, and is of
itself to be supported by property.”</p>

<p><i>Charles C. Pinckney</i>—“Property in
slaves should not be exposed to danger
in a government instituted for the protection
of property.”</p>

<p><i>George Mason</i>—“It would be as unnatural
to refer the choice of a proper
character for President to the people
as to refer a test of colors to a blind
man.”</p>

<p><i>James Madison</i>—“In future times a
great majority of the people will not
only be without landed but any sort
of property. If they combine, the
rights of property will not be safe in
their hands.”</p>

<p><i>James Ellsworth</i>—“As population
grows, poor laborers will be so plenty
as to render slaves useless.”</p>

<p>The thirteen delegates, from whom
I have quoted were the dominating
characters in that convention, and it
is possible to cite innumerable passages
expressing the same distrust and
contempt for the people. It should
be understood that the great mass of
the people had no representation in
that secret conclave, and that half a
century passed before its proceedings
were made public by Act of Congress.</p>

<p>I have touched on these facts for the
purpose of indicating clearly that the
right to ignore the majority is inherent
in the Constitution. The Senate was
provided for the special benefit of property
interests, and at one time a clause
was adopted, decreeing that no one
could be elected a Senator of the
United States unless he was worth
$50,000 or more. This cautious provision
was abandoned because there
were states which had no men with
that amount of property. Having provided
a Senate they continued to pile
up checks against the people, until such
aristocrats as Gerry, Randolph and
Mason attempted to call a halt, declaring
that the people would be so stripped
of power that the last of their rights
would disappear. Their warnings were
disregarded, and they absolutely refused
to sign their names to the document.</p>

<p>With these facts within access of
every citizen of the United States, the
vast majority of us still adhere to the
myths and falsehoods contained in our
school books and uttered by ignorant
demagogues and editors.</p>

<p>It is likely that the aristocratic delegates
who framed the Constitution had
just reason to fear the people it was
intended to hold in check. The average
citizen of 1787 was a savage compared
with the average voter of today.
He knew of no world beyond the narrow
limit of his horizon. He was ignorant,
prejudiced, suspicious and envious.
The builders of the Constitution
regretted that it was necessary to
grant him even the shadow of political
power and were consumed by the dread
that the Lower House of Congress would
overawe all other branches of the new
government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>In that day wealth had little influence
as a mass, but it was strong in its
instinct of self-preservation. It trembled
lest the poor should combine at
the polls in a crusade for the legal despoiling
of the rich. Having absolute
control of the convention it was free to
design a document which would include
every possible check against the aggressions
of the dreaded masses, and
it rightly conjectured that the magic
of the name of Washington would induce
the people to consent to the provisions
aimed against them.</p>

<p>We of today are caught in the trap
set for those who lived more than a hundred
years ago. Not until after the
nation had been plunged into a civil
war between two factions—each of
which claimed strict allegiance to the
Constitution—did conditions arise
which afforded a fair test of the restrictive
features of that document. So
long as the wealth of the nation was
so distributed as to prevent the formation
of conspiracies in its behalf, the
masses were able to conserve their
rights, despite all of the checks and restrictions
in the Constitution. It was
this fairly maintained state of equilibrium
which half a century ago gave
rise to the worship of our system of
government.</p>

<p>When the first unscrupulous man
found himself in possession of millions
of dollars the Constitution became not
his master but his tool. When the
officials of our first great corporation
found it practical to bribe legislation,
the trap set by the forefathers was
sprung. I do not mean to hint that
the founders of the Constitution foresaw
any such outcome. They constructed
a device to protect themselves,
and their bones had crumbled into dust
before wealth was sufficiently armed
and equipped to take advantage of
their mistakes.</p>

<p>Wealth seized upon the senates,
state and national. It found in the
judiciary a natural ally, and it did not
hesitate to invoke the aid of partisanship
and the unblushing use of corrupt
influences, direct and indirect, in order
to subject the courts to its domination.
This is a blunt statement, but the time
has arrived when the courts can no
longer be covered with a machine-made
robe of sanctity. There are good
judges and bad judges, but the decisions
of the latter are as binding as
those of the former. A corporation
judge is not a priest; he is a low type
of politician.</p>

<p>Our aristocratic forefathers designed
a Constitution intended to protect
themselves against a majority. Our
modern corporations and vested interests
have discovered that the same machinery
oiled with bribery can be used
by the minority for the purpose of
plundering the majority. Our forefathers
invented checks; our trusts have
converted them into bludgeons. Our
forefathers constructed constitutional
ramparts, behind which they hoped to
be safe from the attacks of the majority;
our vested interests have bristled
them with guns, behind which they
demand and receive tribute.</p>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">AN EXTRACT FROM THE “LONDON TIMES” OF FEBRUARY 8, 1909</p>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY OWEN OLIVER</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OWING to the lamented death of
Professor Newton, to whose
wisdom and courage the world
owes its deliverance, I have been asked
to contribute to the first newspaper
issued in the new era some account of
the terrible weed which overran the
earth, and threatened to stifle out
mankind.</p>

<p>The professor had intended dealing
with the origin of the weed, its relations
to ordinary plants, the nature of
its growth, so far as this proceeded,
and the forms which it would ultimately
have assumed. Unfortunately his notes
upon these points are so abbreviated
and technical as to be unintelligible to
me; and personally I possess no qualifications
for dealing with the scientific
aspects of the case. So I must
confine myself to a plain narrative of
the occurrences which I witnessed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was nine o’clock in the evening of
November 10, 1908, when I left my
office in Norfolk Street, letting myself
out with a duplicate key which the
hall-porter had intrusted to me. I
thought at first that it was snowing; but
when I put out my hand and caught
a few of the particles, I found that
they were flimsy white seeds, something
like those of melons, only less
substantial. Where they lay in heaps—as
I thought—in the road, their
color appeared to be gray. At the
Embankment end of the street the
“heaps” were larger; and when I came
to them I discovered that they were not
seeds, but a growth of gray weed,
which fastened round my shoes as I
tried to walk over it.</p>

<p>I stooped and took hold of a piece to
examine it; but, when I attempted to
pluck it, it stretched like elastic, without
breaking off. The tendrils were
round, and about one-fourth of an inch
in diameter when not stretched. They
had, at intervals, spherical bulges
which, at a distance, bore the appearance
of small berries. These appeared
to be of the same substance as the tendrils.
The latter began twining round
my fingers, and I had some difficulty in
releasing them. The road and the
Embankment were deserted by people,
but three or four horses at the cab stand
were plunging with fright as the weed
wound round their legs. It had grown
perceptibly in the few minutes that I
had been observing it, and, feeling
somewhat alarmed, I made my way
back along Norfolk Street.</p>

<p>The weed had spread a good deal
there also; and I noticed that wherever
a white seed fell a fresh plant sprang
up, and grew with marvelous rapidity.
In the Strand the weed was nearly a
yard high. The ’bus drivers were whipping
their frightened horses in a vain
attempt to drive over it. The foot-passengers
were unable to move, except
a big man, who, with a small axe,
hacked a passage through the growth
for himself, his wife and his daughter—a
pretty girl of about nineteen.</p>

<p>They were making their way down to
the Embankment, but I warned them
that the weed was thick there. The
young lady then suggested that they
should try to get into one of the houses,
and I invited them to come to my offices.
The tendrils were seizing people and
pulling them down and binding them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
like flies in a spider’s web. We could
hear cries and screams all along the
Strand, and a cab was upset by the
struggles of the horse. The weed had
spread over Norfolk Street, while we
were talking, and it clung to our feet
as we ran. The lady tripped and fell.
The tendrils seized her immediately,
and we had great difficulty in freeing
her. When we had entered the door
of the house we could not close it until
we had chopped away the tendrils that
followed us.</p>

<p>I turned on the electric light in the
halls, and took my new friends to my
rooms, which were on the fifth floor.
The elder lady was faint, and I gave
her some brandy and soda and biscuits.
I had a good stock of these fortunately.</p>

<p>The gentleman’s name was George
Baker, his wife was Marian Baker, and
the girl was Viva. They had been buying
curiosities in the Strand, and the
axe—a roughly engraved Moorish
instrument—was fortunately among
their purchases. Some people whom
they met in the streets had told them
that the weed was growing all over
London, and that the Guards had been
ordered out to cut it away. A learned
old gentleman had conjectured that the
seeds were the atoms of some dissipated
planet, or the elements of some world
that was to be, and that they contained
the raw elements of life, which
set them growing when they came into
contact with suitable matter.</p>

<p>“It’s diabolical!” Mr. Baker said
furiously. “The vestries ought to
send round water-carts with weed-killer,
or—or something. I don’t
know what they ought to do; but
they ought to do something.” He
wiped his face excitedly with his handkerchief.
“Diabolical!” he repeated.
“It grows through the flagstones,
the wood paving, everything. It—it
seizes people!”</p>

<p>“Seizes people!” his wife repeated,
wringing her hands. “We saw it.”</p>

<p>“It clings to you,” the girl added
tremulously. “<i>Clings</i> to you. If it
goes on growing——!”</p>

<p>Her mother gave a sharp scream,
and her father groaned.</p>

<p>“If it goes on growing—!” they
said together.</p>

<p>“It won’t,” I assured them, with an
indifferent appearance of confidence.
“Those things that grow like—like
fungi—never do. It will shrivel up
suddenly, and let people go again. I
don’t suppose they’re really hurt, only
frightened. In an hour or so you’ll
be on your way home, and laughing
about it; and I shall be thanking the—the
fungus—for some pleasant acquaintances.
I look upon this as a little surprise
party.”</p>

<p>The girl wiped her eyes and forced
a smile.</p>

<p>“A little surprise party,” she agreed.
“What are you going to do for our
entertainment, Mr. Adamson?—I saw
the name on the door-plate.”</p>

<p>“Henry Adamson,” I said, “and
very much at your service, Miss Viva—I
have some cards, but——”</p>

<p>I paused doubtfully. Her mother
held up a trembling hand, and her
father shook his head.</p>

<p>“We won’t have any fool’s games,”
he said. “Let’s talk.”</p>

<p>Viva and I talked in broken sentences,
and her mother and father in
monosyllables. We kept glancing at
the window, but no one had the courage
to draw up the blind for nearly an
hour. Then we opened the window
and looked out. The weed was fully
six feet high in the street, and higher
in the Strand. It had overrun the
’bus that stood at the opening. If
there were people on the ’bus, it had
overrun them, too.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to hurt,” I said.
“There’s no screaming now.” I shuddered
as soon as I had said it.</p>

<p>“There is no screaming now,” Viva
repeated. “I suppose they—they are
all——”</p>

<p>Her voice broke. Her father shut
the window sharply and drew her
away.</p>

<p>“It will be gone in the morning,”
he asserted, “as—as our friend said.
We shall have to impose on your
hospitality for the night, I am afraid,
Mr. Adamson.”</p>

<p>“There is no question of imposing,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
I assured him. “I cannot say how glad
I am to have your company.”</p>

<p>We made a couch for the ladies by
putting several hearth-rugs on the
table in the clerks’ room, and laying
two rugs of mine to cover them. Mr.
Baker and I dozed in front of the fire
in my room in chairs. Toward the
morning I fell into a sounder sleep.
When I woke he had pulled up the
blind.</p>

<p>“It’s fifteen feet high at least,” he
told me. “Halfway up the second
windows. God help us!”</p>

<p>I joined him and saw the roadway
filled with a sea of gray weeds. They
looked like india-rubber reeds. The
largest were as thick as my little finger,
and the bulges were the size of damsons.
We opened the window and
listened. Presently a caretaker opened
a window nearly opposite and called to
his wife.</p>

<p>“Here’s a rum go, Mary,” he
shouted, with a laugh. “Bulrushes
growing to the street! We sha’n’t have
any clerks pestering us today.”</p>

<p>The woman joined him, and they
laughed together because they would
have a holiday. They treated the
matter as a joke, and evidently disbelieved
us when we told them of the
terrible events of the preceding night.
So we closed the window and called
the ladies. I made some tea on my
ring-burner, and we breakfasted on
that and biscuits. The ladies avoided
the window, and so did I, but Mr.
Baker went to it every few minutes.
After each visit he whispered to me
that it was still growing. Mrs. Baker
seemed in a stupor, but Viva tried hard
to cheer us. She sang little snatches
of song under her breath as she washed
the tea-cups; and once she said that it
was great “fun.” Her mouth trembled
when I looked reproachfully at her.</p>

<p>“Mother is so nervous,” she whispered.
“I have to pretend, to cheer
her. Do you think it will—grow?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows!” I said. “But
you are very brave.”</p>

<p>After this, she and I sat at the window,
watching the tendrils growing
and growing, and clutching incessantly
at the air. I thought, at first, that they
were swaying in the wind, but there
was no breeze. Also there was an
indescribable air of purpose about
their movement. A number of long
branches spread themselves over a
window opposite. Their swaying
ceased, and they pressed on it steadily,
till at last it broke with a dull crash.
Mrs. Baker fainted, and her husband
lifted her on to the sofa. Viva clung
to my arm. The malicious tendrils
broke down the window-frame, piece
by piece, and spread slowly into the
room, winding themselves round the
tables and chairs.</p>

<p>“If anyone had been there,” Viva
cried hoarsely. “If—if—” She looked
at me. Her eyes were big with fright.</p>

<p>“They must be doing something
to stop it,” I said—“the—the authorities.
If we could find out! I’ll try
the telephone.”</p>

<p>After several calls I obtained an
answer. It was a girl’s voice. Six of
them had stayed all night in the exchange,
she said. They were in communication
with the police and the
Government Offices. The soldiers had
been out since the previous evening,
and had cut their passage from Chelsea
Barracks to Victoria Street, and
along this almost to Westminster
Bridge. They had intended coming on
to Whitehall and the Strand; but the
stuff grew almost as quickly as it was
cut down, and had overpowered many
of them. Over a hundred had been
crushed to death by it, and they had
sent for gun-cotton to try and blow it
up, as a last resort. It was known,
through the telegraph, that the weed
had appeared all over England and on
the Continent. It was also growing
out of the sea. The English Channel
was choked in places, and several
vessels had been bound by the weed in
sight of the coast. “It’s alive!” she
wailed; “alive! Its eyes are watching
us through the windows!” (The
bulges had the appearance of eyes.)</p>

<p>I was unable to obtain any further
answers, although I tried the telephone
several times. By one o’clock
the third-story windows were covered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
The thickest tendrils were then
nearly the diameter of a florin, with
the bulges the size and shape of exceedingly
large plums. The stems and
bulges seemed to be of one homogeneous
material. There were no leaves
or fruit or flowers at this time, but
branches were beginning to sprout
from the main stems. There did not
appear to be any communication between
one stem and another; but, according
to Professor Newton’s notes,
this undoubtedly took place at the
roots, which interlaced so as to form a
gigantic nervous system or brain.</p>

<p>We made another meal of tea and
biscuits. Mrs. Baker seemed stupefied
with horror, and her husband was
evidently overcome by his anxiety for
her, and scarcely spoke. Viva and I
tried to talk, but our voices broke off
in the middle of words. We listened
vainly for any explosions, and concluded
that the attempt at rescue had
failed. By four o’clock the weed was
up to the window-sill. Mrs. Baker was
in a prolonged faint. Her husband sat
beside her, with his head on his hand.
He did not look up when I suggested
carrying her out on the roof.</p>

<p>“The cold would rouse her,” he
said. “It is best as it is. You’re a
good chap, I think. Do what you can
for my little girl.”</p>

<p>I put on my overcoat, crammed the
pockets with biscuits and a flask, and
persuaded Viva to accompany me to
the roof to look for a way of escape,
for us and for her parents. We never
saw them again.</p>

<p>Some people from neighboring houses
were on the adjoining roofs already,
two old caretakers, a man and a lad.
We saw about twenty more on the
roofs in other streets. Some of them
were raving and singing. The caretakers
who had spoken to us in the
morning flung their window open.
They were laughing as if they had been
drinking. They brought two pailfuls
of boiling water and emptied it upon
the weed. There was a soft hissing
sound. Then two—four—six quivering
tendrils reached slowly toward
them. The man and woman seemed
fascinated. They did not attempt to
move, only screamed. The tendrils
seized them; bound them round and
round. Viva buried her head on my
shoulder, and I shut my eyes. It was
about half a minute, I think, before
the screams ceased. Then there was
crash after crash as windows were
broken in. The weed had its passions,
it seemed.</p>

<p>“Take me back to my mother and
father,” Viva begged. “We can all
die together—if you would rather die
with us?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I would rather die with you,
Viva,” I said. “I should have liked
you very much if we had lived.”</p>

<p>We returned to the trap-door, but
the staircase was choked with the
weed. As we looked down it seemed
to be a pit of twirling gray snakes. We
called to her mother and father, but
there was no answer. Viva would have
flung herself among the weed, but I
held her and carried her back to the
roof. The weed was beginning to
crawl over the gutters. Long rope-like
filaments were surrounding the
other people who were on the roofs.
They huddled together and did not attempt
to escape. The tendrils overran
them and bound them round and
round. I think they had mostly fainted.
There was only one cry.</p>

<p>The tendrils lashed one another and
fought over their prey. Their struggles
made a repulsive, “scrooping”
noise—a noise like the sound of stroking
silk, only louder. There was also
a sound of crunching bones.</p>

<p>I did not notice the weed closing
round us till Viva clutched my arm.</p>

<p>“Hold me,” she begged. “Hold me
tight! I thought life had only just begun——”</p>

<p>I supported her on one arm, and
backed toward the Strand end of the
roof, where the weed had encroached
less. We stumbled against a skylight.
The attic below was empty. I opened
the frame, lowered Viva and jumped
down after her. We crouched in a
corner watching the window. One—two
minutes passed. Then the gray
weed, with the bulges that simulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
eyes, pressed upon it. The glass shivered
upon the floor. I lifted Viva in
my arms—she was too faint to walk—and
carried her out on the landing.</p>

<p>The light was bad, and I saw no
weed till we reached the next landing.
Then it stretched toward us from the
broken window-frame. A dozen gray
ropes crept toward us from the stairs
when we approached them. The lift
was standing open. I pushed Viva in,
jumped after her, slid the steel railing
to and lowered us. A tendril caught
at the lift as we started. I heard it
snap.</p>

<p>In my excitement I lowered the lift
too fast. We were thrown against the
sides and almost stunned when it
stopped. There was barely a glimmer
of light, and we did not know if we
had reached the bottom of the shaft
or had been stopped by the weed. We
listened for a long while and heard
nothing. Then we let ourselves out
and advanced a few inches at a time,
feeling round us with our hands. We
seemed to be in the hall of the basement.
We came upon a table and
found a tray on it with biscuits and
milk. We drank the milk and Viva
stuffed the biscuits in her pockets, as
mine were full. There was a dim,
barely perceptible light from an area
window. We peered up through the
grating into the forest of huge weeds.
The trunks, which had grown to the
size of young elms, only swayed a little;
but the branches above twisted and
twined incessantly. Viva shuddered
when she saw them, and I took her
away.</p>

<p>“We are safe down here,” I assured
her; but she pressed her hand over my
mouth.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she whispered. “Hush!
It may hear.”</p>

<p>We wandered about in the darkness
till we found a caretaker’s room. We
sat there on a sofa, holding hands. We
never lost touch of each other all the
time. I do not know how long it was.
It seemed years. The basement was
very quiet, but the sound of the india-rubbery
motion came down to us.
Once or twice we thought we heard a
human cry. Once a mouse squeaked,
and a spider dropped on the couch beside
us with a thud. We were always
listening.</p>

<p>After an unknown time we groped
our way into the scullery to get water.
We had just drunk when we heard the
sound of india-rubbery tentacles dragging
themselves over the walls. Something
clung to my hand. Something
held her skirt. It tore as I pulled her
from it. Something was in the way
when we tried to close the door. It
followed us across the room and into
the passage. We felt along the walls
for the door that we thought led to the
cellars—found it—fastened it after us—groped
down the stairs. It was
darker than the darkness of the basement
above—darkness that could be
felt. We stumbled over some coals—and
a rough, hoarse voice came out of
the darkness.</p>

<p>“Give us your hand, guv’nor,” it
said, “just a touch of your hand. I’ve
been alone here for—for a thousand
years!”</p>

<p>Something staggered toward us—stumbled
against us; and a huge rough
hand gripped my arm.</p>

<p>I put myself between him and Viva
and pressed her arm for silence. The
voice and grip were not reassuring, and
I hoped he did not know she was there.</p>

<p>“Here is my hand,” I said.</p>

<p>“And mine,” said Viva eagerly.
“You are a friend—of course you are a
friend. God bless you.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, lady.” The rough
voice softened strangely. “I—I’m
sorry to intrude.”</p>

<p>He drew back a little way from us
and sat down. I could not see him,
but I could hear him breathe. Another
unknown time passed. Then Viva
whispered that she was thirsty.</p>

<p>“There’s a pail of water,” the man
said, “if I can find it.” He moved
about in the darkness till he kicked it.
Then he brought it to us. We drank
from the pail and ate a few biscuits.
I offered him some, but he said that he
had a crust left. Viva and I explored
the cellar and found a shovel and a
pick. I suggested that we should try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
to break through into the next cellar,
on the chance of finding food; but Viva
and the man feared that the weed
might hear us.</p>

<p>She and I sat on an empty packing-case,
and she laid her head on my
shoulder and slept. After a time I
slept too. The man woke us.</p>

<p>“There’s something moving, guv’nor,”
he said hoarsely. “I think it’s
growing out of the floor. Strike a
match, and give me the shovel.”</p>

<p>We found forty or fifty weed plants
growing. He beat some down with the
shovel, but others clutched him round
the legs. He was a strong, rough-looking
man and he fought furiously,
but they pulled him down. I gave
Viva the matches and went to his rescue
with the pick. The weeds seized
me too, but he cut us both free with a
clasp-knife, and at length we destroyed
them all.</p>

<p>We saw by the matchlight that the
wall was cracking in one place. So we
resolved to try to get through it. The
man dislodged a few bricks with the
pick, and we pulled others away till
our fingers bled and the last match
gave out. At length he managed to
crawl through.</p>

<p>“You come next, sir,” he proposed.
“The lady would be frightened of me.”</p>

<p>“Dear friend,” Viva said, “I am not
in the least afraid of you.”</p>

<p>So he helped her through, and I followed.
We discovered a passage, and
along the passage another doorway—and
people. I do not remember our
words when we found one another in
the dark—only the gladness of it.</p>

<p>There were about twenty of them—men,
women and children. They had
food and drink which they had collected
before they fled to the cellar.
Professor Newton was among them.
He seemed acknowledged as their
leader, and he proposed me as his second.
He wanted the aid of an intelligent
and educated man, he whispered,
in fighting the weed.</p>

<p>“We <i>must</i> fight it,” he declared,
tapping me on the arm with his finger,
“but I don’t know how. I—don’t—know—how!—I
can’t even guess what
it is; still less what it is going to be.
It may be mere vegetable life—a man-eating
plant. It may be brute animal
life—a <i>carnivorous</i> animal! It may
be intelligent—diabolical intelligence.
Whatever it is, it will develop as it
grows, develop new organs and new
powers, new strength and new weaknesses.
We must strike <i>there</i>. What
weaknesses? Ah-h! I don’t know!
It may outgrow itself and wither. It
may perish from the little microbes of
the earth, like the Martians in Wells’s
romance. We thought that an idle
fancy <i>then</i>. It may grow into an intelligent—devil!
It may be one now
and merely lack the organs to carry out
fully its evil will. On the other hand,
its malevolence may be purposeless—a
blind restlessness that it will outgrow—after
we have stifled in the darkness
at its feet. We must fight it anyhow.
To fight it we must understand it. To
understand it we must study it. Will
you risk your life with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>Viva cried softly when I told her I
must go; but she did not try to keep
me from my duty. The professor and
I crawled up the stairs into the basement,
and finding nothing there went
up in the lift in the dark. We heard
the weed moving about on the second
landing. I jumped out, turned on the
electric light, and jumped in again.
The tendrils followed me and clutched
at the steel curtain, but could not
break it. We hacked with our pen-knives
at those that crept through.
The juice which ran out from them had
an oily smell. They beat furiously on
the curtain. The professor studied
them calmly with a microscope. The
bulges were the beginning of eyes, he
thought. He pronounced some feathery
sprays sprouting from them to be
the rudiments of organs like hands. I
do not know whether he was right,
but he always maintained that they
would develop organs of sense. Anyhow
the character of the weed was
clearly changing. It had grown harder
and drier, but without losing its flexibility
or strength.</p>

<p>After a time the professor decided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
that I should return to the others. He
went up again in the lift when he had
lowered me. Viva was waiting for me
in the dark just inside the door.</p>

<p>I had obtained some candles. We
lit one and stuck it in a bottle. I shall
never forget the group in the low, wide
cellar, huddled together on boxes or on
the floor. The man we met first was
nursing an ailing child. Lady Evelyn
Angell had gathered a young flower-girl
under her opera cloak. A policeman
was binding up a wounded hand
with his handkerchief. A shivering
old match-seller wore his cape. Viva
took a little boy on her lap and told
him about Jack and the Beanstalk.
Steel—a card sharper, I learned afterward—who
had been indefatigable
in helping everyone, was chatting to
Lady Evelyn. Some ill-clad youths
had draped themselves in sacking. A
rouged and gaudily dressed woman
was mothering some younger ones.
She had comforted Viva while I was
away, I heard, and had offered to accompany
her in a search for me, but
the others had persuaded them that
they would only be a hindrance to us.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours—I had
wound my watch again—the professor
reappeared. His clothes were torn
and his face and hands were bleeding.</p>

<p>“They broke the steel curtain at
last,” he explained, “but I got away.
Good heavens, how it grows! I can’t
make up my mind about it.”</p>

<p>After a time, when most of us were
dozing, a portion of the roof and the
wall fell in. The growth of the roots
under the street had pressed the earth
upon it, the professor conjectured. A
faint light streamed down the tall
weeds and through the opening. The
branches overhead were still moving,
but the lower stems seemed inert. The
professor decided to venture among
them in search of knowledge. I went
with him. There was just room enough
between the weeds for us to pass.</p>

<p>The houses upon the other side of
the street were all down. So were
many in the Strand. In Fleet Street
we saw the way it was done. The huge
weeds leaned upon them, till they fell
with a crash. The Law Courts went
so. We found the clock among
the weeds. Sometimes the branches
pushed themselves through the windows
and walls of houses which were
still standing. Once or twice we
heard human cries. We found a
woman, with a baby and a dog, walking
among the weed-trees, and took
them with us.</p>

<p>The light which straggled down
through the waving branches overhead
was feeble and patchy, and we
lost our way for a time. At length we
found Norfolk Street; but as we were
entering it, some of the tendrils, which
seemed to be fighting one another
viciously overhead, broke off and
dropped at our feet. They writhed
upon the ground like huge gray snakes,
and wound themselves round the weed-trees
and lashed out blindly. One of
them caught the woman and dashed
her against a trunk. We pulled her
away from the tendril as its violence
lessened, but she was dead. The baby
was not hurt and still slept. I carried
it in my arms.</p>

<p>A moment later a broken tendril
dropped right upon the dog. He
howled loudly, and in his fright bit at
an unbroken tendril hanging down
among the trees. (There were a good
many such, but we had succeeded in
avoiding them hitherto.) It shook
as if with rage and pain, wrapped its
extremity round the dog, and bore
him aloft, still howling. Hundreds
of tendrils stretched toward it, and
fought with it for the dog. They still
fought after his cries ceased; and other
tendrils began reaching downward, in
every direction round us, as if searching
for further prey. The professor watched
them intently, oblivious of danger.</p>

<p>“They make a different sound now,”
he remarked abstractedly. “It is no
longer the scroop-scroop of clammy
india-rubber—they <i>rustle</i>. It doesn’t
seem like decay. They are stronger—stronger.
There is always weakness in
excess of anything—even strength.
Let me think!”</p>

<p>“Quick!” I cried. “Quick! They
are falling upon us. Run!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>We dodged rapidly among the weed-trunks.
He was slow and I pushed
him. Tendril after tendril rustled
downward, and the trunks themselves
swayed. Two almost fixed the professor
between them—he was a stout
man—but I dragged him through.
The light from above was entirely shut
out by the descending tendrils, and we
must have been lost but for an electric
lamp burning in one of the houses.
As it was, the descending tendrils must
have caught us but for their struggles
among themselves. Broken pieces
dropped and wriggled madly all round
us, and we had to dodge them. One
caught at my foot, and dragged my
shoe off as I pulled myself away. Several
touched us as we slid down the
debris into the cellar. They followed
us there.</p>

<p>A few of the people screamed. A
few fainted. The rest backed in a
huddled, wide-eyed crowd toward the
farthest wall. Lady Evelyn stood in
front of the children, holding out her
arms as if to shelter them. Steel came
and stood in front of her.</p>

<p>“Dear lady,” he said, “these have
been the best days of my life—since
we met. I should have been a better
man if I had met you before.” She
smiled very sweetly at him.</p>

<p>“I like you greatly, Mr. Steel,” she
said.</p>

<p>The rouged woman came and took
the baby from me, and I tried to pull
the professor back; but he would not
come. Viva ran out from the crowd
and put her arms round me. The
tendrils drew nearer and nearer. Some
came along the ceiling, hanging their
heads like snakes. Others crawled
along the floor, raising themselves as
if to dart at us. I do not know whether
they saw us, heard us or smelt us, or
how they knew where we were; but
they knew.</p>

<p>They were within a yard of the professor,
and still he did not move; only
took the burning candle from the
bottle, and railed at them as if they
could hear. I thought that he had gone
mad.</p>

<p>“Do you think man has learned
nothing in his thousand generations?”
he shouted. “That you can crush him
with the brute strength of a few days?
Come and see! Come and see!”</p>

<p>The foremost tentacle wound round
him; began to lift him. He felt it
carefully with his hands. “It is dry,”
he shouted—“<i>dry!</i>”</p>

<p><i>Then he put the candle to it!</i></p>

<p>There was a wilderness of white
light. Then a purple darkness. I heard
the professor fall. When our eyes recovered
from their dazed blindness the
weed was utterly gone. The daylight
was streaming into the hole in the
wall, and the professor was picking
himself up from the floor. His hair
and beard were badly singed, and his
eyebrows were gone.</p>

<p>“It dried too fast,” he told us, with
a queer angry chuckle. “That was its
weakness. It dried—dried——”</p>

<p>He kept on repeating the word in a
dull, aimless tone. The rest repeated
it vacantly after him. Viva was the
first to speak coherently—a faint
whisper in my ear.</p>

<p>“My dear!” she said. “My <i>dear</i>!”</p>

<p>Lady Evelyn spoke next—to ex-card
sharper Steel.</p>

<p>“The world begins afresh,” she
said; “and—you <i>have</i> met me, Mr.
Steel.”</p>

<p>The tears rolled down her cheek
and his, and they stood smiling at each
other.</p>

<p>“The world begins afresh,” the professor
called in a loud voice. “Come
with me and make it a better world.”
He strode toward the light, but some
held back.</p>

<p>“The weed!” they cried timorously.</p>

<p>“The weed has gone—burned in an
instant, from the end of the world to
the end of the world!” he assured them.
“Follow me.”</p>

<p>We followed him out of the darkness
into the sunlight. It was a mild, bright
day for November, and a pleasant air.</p>

<p>The weed had disappeared entirely,
as the professor predicted; and, speaking
generally, the conflagration had
been too sudden to do much harm; but
most of the buildings had subsided
upon the sudden destruction of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>
weed-roots which had undermined
them. Here and there houses, stones
and timber had caught fire; and in
many districts the fire spread, and
lasted for days.</p>

<p>The statistics, which are being prepared
in the New Department for the
Service of the People, over which I
have the honor to preside, are not yet
quite complete; but I may mention
that seventeen per cent. of the buildings
on the north of the Thames are
found to have been destroyed, and
ninety-three per cent. on the south—the
wind having blown mainly in that
direction; and that the destruction of
property in Great Britain and Ireland
generally is roughly estimated at fifty-five
per cent.</p>

<p>The adventures of our little band,
after we came out from our hiding-place,
scarcely belong to this story;
but I must set down a few events
which stand out in red letters in our
calendar of the world after the Gray
Weed.</p>

<p>Upon the first afternoon we learned
that there were other survivors—which
we had not dared to hope—by
finding a man, woman and child
nearly dead with hunger and fright,
hiding in a basement. We formed ourselves
at once into small parties to go
round London, wherever houses yet
stood, and rang the church bells, and
blew trumpets, and beat drums, and
shouted to all those who remained to
come out. Here and there frightened
groups of white-faced, famished, disheveled
people answered the call. As
our numbers increased we sent parties
to search the cellars and other hiding-places,
and rescued many at their last
gasp. The total number of survivors
in London, where the percentage of
deaths was highest, amounts to some
35,000.</p>

<p>Upon the second day we obtained
several replies to our calls by telegraph
to the provinces; and the next
day we were in telegraphic communication
with most parts of the United
Kingdom and even the Continent. In
almost all towns at least one or two
persons had escaped. In some parts
the Gray Weed had left open spaces,
or a few houses, to which people could
flee, and only a portion of those who
reached them had died from starvation.
In a few instances it was alleged
to have refrained from injuring those
with whom it came in contact. Also
it failed to crush many of the ships
which it seized at sea—the sea-growths
generally being less virulent than those
on land. So far as our statistics go at
present, we hope that nearly one-eighth
of the population of Europe
has survived.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the first train
from the provinces to London was run;
and several ships, which the weed had
overgrown without injuring, came into
port. After this, traffic was rapidly
re-established.</p>

<p>A fortnight later our present government
was provisionally established.
The professor, whom all hailed as their
deliverer, refused office himself; but
upon his nomination I was appointed
to my present position. Several of our
little band were assigned important
posts, including Steel—now known by
another name, and married to Lady
Evelyn—and Viva, who is presiding
over the London Homes for Orphans,
until our marriage. The day after
tomorrow a newspaper appears.</p>

<p>We have toiled unremittingly to
reconstruct the social and commercial
life of the country, and not without
success. We have few luxuries, but no
wants; fewer workers, but no drones;
fewer to love—but we love more—I
think the world will go well, now, because
we love one another so much.</p>

<p>“The Gray Weed has solved the
problems of poverty, envy, crime and
strife, which have puzzled mankind
for ages,” the professor said, just before
he died. “Don’t cry, little Viva.
Ah! But I felt a tear on my hand!
There is nothing to cry about, my
child. <i>They</i> have gone; and <i>I</i> am going;
but <i>you</i> have learned to love. It is all
for the best!”</p>

<p>“All—for—the—best,” he repeated
at the last, and smiled. That is his
message to you to whom I write, dear
friends.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>With Caste Against Him</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY HUGH PENDEXTER</p>

<p class="drop-cap">TIBERIUS Smith in love was a
spectacle I had never conjured
up. Billy Campbell, the strolling
actor and his patron’s Boswell,
had pictured the old showman to me
as being arrested for a spy in Russia,
for a madman in France, for a too
active Carlist in Spain and for smuggling
opium in China, but he had never
hinted at sentiment. I had taken it
for granted that Smith’s many wanderings
over the face of the earth with his
various theatrical enterprises and circuses
had eliminated any inclination
for love-sickness, and it seems it had
until he met the lord’s daughter.</p>

<p>That was like Smith. It was impossible
to conceive of him as married
and settled down, and when he did fall
in love it was his characteristic to indulge
in a hopeless passion. For all
that, the lord’s daughter was forced to
see him at his best, sturdy and resourceful,
when others failed her, and
I doubt not but that this knowledge
was sadly sweet to the old showman,
and that in after years he enjoyed diagnosing
the climax and realizing it was
superbly dramatic. If she ignored his
existence at first, he had the keen pleasure
of knowing she had only him to rely
on at a most critical finale and that
her world was better, much better, for
his having lived.</p>

<p>Possibly the trick could have been
turned without him, turned in a prosaic
manner with some bloodshed and
a great waste of gunpowder. But
when a lovely girl is the stake, be she
a lord’s daughter or a queen from the
masses, it is sometimes advisable to
finesse. And Tiberius, if slightly melodramatic,
solved the problem as he
could only do, and as only he could
do—that is, in an unusual manner.
Campbell used to style him the “assassin
of adversity,” and his peculiar
faculty of rescuing the weak from undesirable
situations was, perhaps, never
better demonstrated than when, with
cutter bars down, he restored the English
girl to her people and incidentally
introduced the uses and abuses of modern
farming implements to some unsophisticated
savages in a lonely Pacific
isle.</p>

<p>I had recurred to the time when
Tiberius piloted an Uncle Tom’s Cabin
company up and down the land, and
Billy, gazing sadly into my open grate,
irrelevantly observed:</p>

<p>“Yes; and that was when Tib ought
to have won her and settled down.
He was clear daffy over that girl, and
I’ll admit she was a hummer; one, you
know, that would make a man abandon
his grandmother in a blinding snowstorm
if it pleased her. But I reckon
Fate had other work cut out for Tiberius
besides spooning, love in a cottage
and no money for the iceman and all
that sort of stuff. Yes, it was fully
ten years ago that the <i>Kalanke</i> broke
her propeller.”</p>

<p>“You are speaking of a boat?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“Lord bless you, yes. The <i>Kalanke</i>
was one of Lord Blam’s boats; ran
from the Coast to Australia. You see,
Tib got the bee that an Uncle Thomas
show would take in Australia like four
squaws in a no-limit game; and once
he had outlined the bill of fare, there
were plenty of us come-ons pushing
out our plates and begging for a helping.
I suppose that when it came to
the realm of pure “con” there wasn’t
a hypnotist doing a mail order business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
that could lay it on quite so succulent
and plausible as he. Lord, we <i>had</i> to
believe him. He believed in himself.</p>

<p>“‘Why, Harriet,’ he cried, drawing
up his dear, fat old form and looking
more honest than any real estate dealer
you ever kenned; ‘why, Harriet, don’t
linger over the paltry twelve dollars a
week I’m supposed to pay you. Don’t
even hesitate. Forget that part of it.
Imagine you are paying me for the
chance to go. Picture, if you please,
Opportunity, clean-shaven and bald-headed,
gliding by your door in a seventy-eight
horse-power gasolene romp-about
at the mirk hour of midnight
with you chloroformed and locked in
your gilded cage. Picture me with a
jiu-jitsu strangle hold on Oppo, detaining
him until you can come to, slip
into your Horse Show gown and come
down and relieve me. Then you are
feasting your magnetic orbs on truth.
Why, the people down there will be
so worked up over your “Papa, dear
papa, set Uncle Tom free,” that they’ll
wreck your hotel with showers of gold.’</p>

<p>“She was a slim, ingrowing woman,
who always played the Little Eva parts
and was the teariest thing ever between
the wings. Clarence, her husband,
booked for Legree, balked a little
and said he’d stand a blankety, blank,
all blanks, nice chance of getting his
showers in lead after he’d massacred
Thomas. But Tib poured a little balm
into his wounds, and that was how we
came to hop the <i>Kalanke</i> for Australia.</p>

<p>“The boat was one of Lord Blam’s
new line and was fixed up regardless.
Besides the passengers, she did quite a
freight business and carried our lots of
horses and farm implements. Our
troupe traveled second class except
Tib, who always went the limit—or
walked. Besides the company there
weren’t many passengers aboard, as it
was in the dull season; but we hadn’t
cuffed the deep blue for more than two
days before Tib met his fate.</p>

<p>“She was the English girl, all blue
eyes, and peaches for complexion; and
Tib haunted her usual promenade like
a mosquito. She was the lord’s only
daughter and was making a flying trip
to Sydney, where her father lay ill.
She had hurried from Washington to
’Frisco and caught the boat with her
maid. The Captain was the rest of her
bodyguard. But Tib had the Captain
solid at the go-in, and through him and
his own gall he managed to speak to
Miss Mary.</p>

<p>“She was about as approachable as
the Eiffel Tower. She was the first bit
of peerage I had ever seen traveling
alone, and I would prefer trying to get
chummy with an iceberg to speaking to
her. But a man or a woman had to be
armor plate to withstand Tib when he
put himself out, and at the end of one
day he had made her laugh; then she
got a bit interested in him and I knew
he was spinning romance.</p>

<p>“When he got to giving his Vermont
family an old chateau environment and
spoke of the good old days at ‘The
Oaks,’ and his father’s pack of hounds,
aristocracy wanted to crawl into a safe
deposit vault and slam the door or get
scalped. He could jam more poetry
and <i>pâté de foie gras</i> breeding into his
round form and look more dreamy passion
from his pleading eyes than any
man that ever made a house believe a
bum show was a good one. He was all
right, I tell you, and if Little Eva
hadn’t butted in when we were doing
things to the equator, and asked him
to come down and play stud-poker in
the smoking-room, I reckoned he’d
have won a few plighted troths anyway.
I shall always believe he had
her clinging to the ropes when Eva
made the fatal stab.</p>

<p>“‘Do you know those people in the
second cabin?’ demanded Her Lordship
with an eighty-two degrees north
voice.</p>

<p>“Tib groaned and tore his brown
hair and admitted he owned us. ‘The
vase is broken,’ he cried. ‘I’ve got the
bell and it’s back to the barriers.’</p>

<p>“Well, he felt so bad over that girl
that he almost wept. It wa’n’t her
titled papa, or the coat of arms; it was
just a case of She. When he was talking
to her he forgot he was merely a
showman. He believed all about the
old ivy-covered manse and the hounds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
Why, I’ve even heard him call the pups
by name. And his father never owned
anything more blue-blooded than a
sheepdog.</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ he said to me as we
smoked down aft, ‘I never met a girl
yet I felt so soft over. I know I’m
older than she by some years, but I
keep my age locked up in the baggage-room
and we might have been happy if
not for Little Eva.’</p>

<p>“And Miss English was mad. She
scolded the Captain for presenting Tib,
and told him her father would do things
once we’d sighted old earth. And the
Captain was on the anxious seat, for
her father was his meal ticket and had
delegated him to fetch out his daughter
O. K. But on the next night we
began to forget it, when we steamed
into the heart of a flying wedge of terrific
winds.</p>

<p>“I decided that if ever we got ashore
it would be to have the folks come
down to the beach and look at us and
say, ‘How natural they look.’ Some
of the gingerbread works were carried
away the first night of the blow, and
whenever the wind let up a bit the live
stock would throw in a few <i>ensembles</i>
that made one pray for more breeze.
Yet the boat behaved well, and if something
hadn’t happened to the propeller
we’d have come through in rare form.
But when the chief engineer began to
parade out his kit and try to mend
things while standing on his head I
knew the game was getting serious.
Now we were bumped by every billow,
and I heard a petty officer whisper that
we were being driven far from our
course.</p>

<p>“At last the kick stopped, or else
we’d slipped out of the storm zone,
and at about three o’clock in the morning
we dropped anchor near a dear
little island that the Captain couldn’t
name with any great degree of exactness.</p>

<p>“The anchorage was so good and the
water so smooth that our engineer said
it would be easy to take the boat to
pieces and put it together without
losing even a shingle nail. Well, you
can indulge in a small wager that we
were all up and happy when we came
near enough to smell the land. The sky
was clear and peppered over with incandescent
lights, and Tib felt so good
that he waltzed up to the She Saxon
and observed: ‘I regret you have been
inconvenienced by the storm.’</p>

<p>“Say, she just turned and dragged
her two sapphires up and down his
anatomy as if he were a seven-leaf clover.
Then she stabbed him four times
with as many glances and turned and
walked forward to the Captain. Cap
wheeled around with his lips pursed up
to say something unwholesome, but
seeing who it was he swallowed it, and
it hurt. Then she asked something
in a low voice and he shook his head
slowly. Then she stamped her hoof
and he seemed to give way. At last
he called a man to him and gave some
orders. The next thing we knew a
boat was dropped and she was being
rowed ashore by four sailors.</p>

<p>“‘Isn’t it rather dangerous to let the
lady go ashore?’ asked Tib of the
Captain.</p>

<p>“This gave the Captain a fine chance
to ease his mind, and he did it by pouring
out his whole heart to Tib in a comprehensive
flow of profanity. He
cursed Tib up hill and down, but Tib
was so round it all glanced off. Cap
told him that Miss Mary had gone
ashore to get rid of his presence. Tib
shuddered. Then the Cap reminded
him that a British skipper takes sass
from no one except the owners, and ordered
him back with the rest of us.
Another gilt braid sneaked up and told
Tib the Cap meant nothing, that he was
only feeling cross at being delayed. As
to Miss Mary, he swore she was as safe
when guarded by the four tars as she
would be on her father’s deck. Besides,
the island was probably vacant,
he added, and she would take a short
stroll on the beach beneath the stars and
then return. But Tib was uneasy.
He said no one could ever diagnose
the disposition of the average cut-up
residing on an oceanian isle. ‘Billy,’
he concluded, ‘I’m cut to the heart.
She won’t even look at the same ocean
with me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“In about an hour’s time, just as the
sun was lazily crawling out of his bed
of blue—say, old chap, that sounds voluptuous
as well as poetic, doesn’t it?—well,
as the sun appeared there came
to our ears a loud cry from the beach,
and we could see some dots bobbing up
and down trying to act intelligent. In
two jumps the Captain shot off in a
boat, and, without seeming to touch
land, was back again on the run.</p>

<p>“The lord’s daughter had been carried
off by the natives, was the startling
intelligence he fed out to his officers.
It seems she wanted to walk up
a little hill and get a view of the sea,
and, although the sailors protested, she
had ordered them to remain behind;
and, like idiots, they obeyed her. Then
they heard a smothered scream and ran
to the rescue, only to meet with a
shower of spears and clubs and to witness
a large band of barefooted taxpayers
making off with the skirts. One
of the sailors had his arm broken,
another had a spear through his shoulder,
and all were badly bruised and
battered. The Captain was crazy. He
ordered his men to arm and rush to
the rescue. At first he was going to
lead them, but some of his officers
soothed him down a bit and made him
see his place was with the boat. It
was not only necessary to rescue Miss
Mary, but the tub must be in condition
to carry her away when she was
recovered.</p>

<p>“But when Tib asked permission to
join the posse the Captain broke loose
again and swore he’d have the boss in
irons. If it hadn’t been for Tib it
never would have happened, he cried.
I chipped in then and reminded him
Her Lordship was too high and mighty
to hunt for an exit just to avoid a
mere man, and I closed with the Stars
and Stripes and our consul in Australia.
This distracted his attention a bit, for
he forgot Tib in swearing at our consular
service.</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ groaned Tib, ‘I guess the
Cap is right, and I’m to blame for her
going ashore. But these volunteers
will never get her by hunting the
brownies with a brass band.’</p>

<p>“Well, we put in several long hours
of waiting, and then two men returned
and said reinforcements were needed,
as the men had discovered a large village
a few miles inland, which they
didn’t dare to attack alone.</p>

<p>“‘Guess you’d better let some of the
passengers chip into this game now,’
advised Tib.</p>

<p>“The Captain began to rave again,
but, seeing that the men left were
needed in making repairs, he had to
give in. Just then some more of the
crew came back to the beach and, once
aboard, panted that the colored folk
were getting aggressive and wouldn’t
even wait to be attacked.</p>

<p>“‘To the boats, men!’ cried the Captain,
while the steward served out howitzers.</p>

<p>“Before the order could be obeyed
the officers and the rest of the gang
rushed down to the beach. Their news
was worst of all. They said the heathens
had produced Her Lordship in view
of all and had threatened to kill her if
her friends didn’t beat a retreat.</p>

<p>“‘If we show violence she’s lost,’
sobbed one of the men.</p>

<p>“The Captain was dazed. He was
brave enough and would gladly fight
to the last gasp; but he didn’t want to
recover Miss Mary dead. He tried to
mumble something about strategy, and
Tib caught it. It was the psychological
moment for him.</p>

<p>“‘If you’ll turn the management of
this show over to me I’ll go and get
her,’ he said simply.</p>

<p>“Some jeered him in wild anger, some
eyed him in amazement, and others
were ready to grasp at any suggestion.</p>

<p>“‘I mean it,’ he repeated firmly,
drawing up his fat form and beginning
to radiate heart waves. ‘Force will
avail nothing, except to kill the lady.
Do as I say and let the galleries back
me and a few of my men, and I honestly
believe we can turn the riffle.’</p>

<p>“Discipline was lost sight of as all
clamored for pointers. ‘Hoist up a
few mowing machines from the hold,
drop twice as many horses over into
the surf, while the carpenters are knocking
together a float. Then ferry the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
grass clippers ashore and have your
mechanics put them together. That’s
the scenario.’</p>

<p>“Some said he was crazy, but I believed
he could fill his hand if they let
him alone, and the Captain asked if he
intended to palm off the mowers as
machine guns.</p>

<p>“‘If they can’t recognize a mowing
machine you don’t expect ’em to be
conversant with Maxims, do you?’
groaned Tib. ‘No; I’ll play ’em as
mowing machines and win out at that.
I believe they’ll be big medicine with
the natives.’</p>

<p>“Of course the Captain pooh-poohed
the scheme. He said the niggers would
kill the lass before the paraphernalia
could be thrown together.</p>

<p>“‘And while you’re doing nothing
and can think of nothing to do, they
may kill her,’ cried Tib. ‘And her
blood be upon your head! Mine is the
only plan that’s been advanced, and it
is practical. It’s unusual, but you
can’t impress these folks with shotguns.
It’s got to be something new in the way
of scenic effect. If I had an airship
I’d use that. But I haven’t. We can
use the mowing machines and stagger
the banditti. We can start in three
hours if you’ll only give the word. Besides,
I shall want the full chorus to
follow with their batteries. You lose
nothing, unless it be me and some of
my friends and the machines.’</p>

<p>“‘Hoist ’em up,’ commanded the
Captain, and the gang caught Tib’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“‘Now, who’s game for a little
romp?’ asked Tib gently of us actors,
his brown eyes collecting in two
needle points. ‘I want my own men
for the leading parts in this deal. Now,
who’s game?’</p>

<p>“Of course I said I was, as I owed
him poker money. Little Eva’s husband
said if he could have one more
drink he’d play tag with the devil, and
Uncle Tom was on if he didn’t have
to black up. Tib wanted one more
operator, and a young fellow that was
coming out to hold down a stool in his
father’s branch house in Sydney agreed
to chip in if he could have time to write
something sad to his parents. Tib
reminded him the postman wouldn’t
have time to collect the mail before we
returned, and so the five of us made
ready. The Captain ached to go, but
Tib reminded him he must take command
of the rear-guard.</p>

<p>“I was for grabbing up a papaw
root and dashing blindly into the weeds,
but Tib held us all back as he outlined
his scheme more fully. The mowing
machines would dazzle the natives, he
contended, and while he and his men
were trifling with the aborigines’ superstitions
the Captain and his bullies
were to rush in, surround the captive,
or else cover Tib’s retreat, once he had
rescued her. And say! You never saw
men work as did those boys on the
<i>Kalanke</i>. The donkey engine was
mounted in a trice and the big crates,
containing the mowing machines, intended
for peaceful pastoral scenes,
were yanked out on deck. By that time
the carpenters had put a raft together
and the clippers were soon
ashore with a bevy of mechanics impatiently
waiting to get in their
work. When the different parts of the
machines had been assembled and
joined each to his neighbor, some half-crazed
draft horses came through the
surf and were promptly caught. Then
boxes of harness were ripped open,
and there we were, as gay a cluster
of charioteers as you would meet with
outside a star production of ‘Ben
Hur.’</p>

<p>“Tib, as the head Mazeppa, jumped
onto the first auto completed and
tested the gearing. Then with his hat
tipped jauntily over his right ear he
reminded the Captain that the crew
should loiter not too far in the rear,
but always out of sight of the enemy,
until we gave the signal to advance,
three pistol shots. Then he cried,
‘Cutter bars up!’ and away we clanked
around the base of the low hill.</p>

<p>“We had received tips as to the
course to take, and it would have done
your heart good, sir, could you have
seen us in that bringing-in-the-sheaves
effect. We only needed wide-brimmed
straw hats, with handkerchiefs knotted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
carelessly about our throats, to be the
village heroes in the average rural
melodrama.</p>

<p>“The land, lucky for us, lay flat and
hard baked by the sun, once we were
around the hill. Then Tib’s good
sense in picking his own men was
demonstrated. Always in the lead as
we trundled over the hard ground, he
had only to move his hand to cause us
to catch the signal and obey. Back
of us, scuttling through the occasional
brush, was our bodyguard, and the
glint of the sun on the gun metal was
a wonderful antidote for homesickness.
In advance a fringe of woods told where
the English girl was held captive. We
expected to encounter outposts, but I
reckon the foe measured our love for
a woman by their own standard and
couldn’t conceive of a man risking his
life to save a squaw.</p>

<p>“At last we struck the shade and
sure enough found a broad avenue between
the trees, just as the boatswain
had mapped out. Then came another
level stretch, only not so long as the
first, bounded by a slight rise. It was
just beyond this that the village was
located. We approached as slyly as we
could and cautiously gained the top
without being interrupted. Just below
us was the encampment, consisting of
several scores of low huts. They were
arranged like the spokes of a wheel,
with broad streets radiating from the
centre. The voters were having a big
powwow, and they made so much noise
that they had failed to catch the sound
of our steeds or wheels.</p>

<p>“‘Now, children, list,’ commanded
Tib. ‘I’m going to drive straight ahead.
Billy will wend his way to the right
and pick up the first spoor, followed
by Simon Legree, who takes the second
trail. Uncle Tom takes the first left
aisle, followed by young Add Six and
Carry Two. And we’ll form a cluster,
God willing, in the centre of the exposition,
where there seems to be a
commodious green. Attention! Cutter
bars down! Forward, trot!’</p>

<p>“And we five chauffeurs dashed into
the hippodrome in the most ridiculous
fashion. Tib bounced up and down like
a rubber ball, and to fall from the seat
meant a badly sliced up white man.
But the effect was stupendous. I
reckon the brunettes never before gazed
on such wags as we must have appeared
to be. Bang! Smash! we rode through
their rotten village, and the machines
needed oiling. Of all the rasping, clattering
noises you ever heard, sir!
Black nightmares rushed to get out
of the way as we cleaned out the
lanes.</p>

<p>“Snip! snip! and Tib had shaved off
the corner of a mud villa. Crunch!
and Simon picked up a totem pole.
Every tooth in those five cutter bars
was working and the collateral we
chewed up didn’t do ’em a bit of good.
But, as Tib said, it was only a one-night
stand and our game was to sell tickets
and ramble away. So on we careened,
the horses wild with fright, now and
then the shears picking up a brown
toe as some devotee fell prostrate in
his flight and babbled a cast-iron
prayer to some burglar-proof god. It
simply swept them off their feet, sir.
Before they woke up we had entered
the middle square.</p>

<p>“And if there wasn’t Her Lordship,
trussed up between two poles, white as
death!</p>

<p>“‘If you’ll pardon the bucolic style
of my turnout, dear lady, I should be
felicitated to have you accompany me
back to the ship,’ cried Tib cheerily
as he slashed her free and held her so
she would not fall. And during it all
he was apparently oblivious to the
frescoes of black faces staring in stupid
awe in the background.</p>

<p>“‘Can it be I’m saved!’ she whimpered,
brushing back her twenty-two-carat
hair with an uncertain gesture.</p>

<p>“‘Tut, tut,’ cried Tib heartily as he
took her hand and tripped a merry
morris toward his chariot. ‘I guess
there’s no danger. These people are
simply crude in their deportment and
evidently believed you some wandering
goddess and would detain you
awhile.’</p>

<p>“‘You are a brave and a good man,’
she choked.</p>

<p>“‘I guess your hosts think me the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
devil. Excuse me, lady,’ salaamed
Tib.</p>

<p>“‘Never a man took greater risk,’
she murmured.</p>

<p>“‘An Uncle Tom’s Cabin company,
lady, will take any risk, or anything
outside a church,’ replied Tib. ‘Whoa,
Montezuma. Now hop up here on my
knee. These bronze pieces will come
to their senses in a second.’</p>

<p>“And when Her Lordship jumped
up into his arms the wonder-stricken
gang gave a howl and came out of their
trance. We countermarched in those
rigs so that Tib had the lead when we
quit the plaza, but not before one big
buck, attired in a war club and a workmanlike
spear, gave a grunt of disapproval
and raised his trowel behind
Tib’s back. I had been expecting one
of them would draw to that card, and
while his arm was pulled back I pinked
him from the hip, and the sunlight was
turned off so far as he was concerned.
But they didn’t mind crowding into
hell so long as they could regain the
woman, and my shot took the Japanese
out of only one of them. And as we
swarmed up the slight rise they came
yowling along behind us, disturbing
the peace in a variety of ways. But
just as Simon Legree fired three shots
in quick succession a fringe of strained-faced
tars popped over the crest in
front, preceded by the busy end of
their repeaters. Under cover of their
diversion we gained the top and bounced
down on the other side with the neighbors
renewing their pursuit.</p>

<p>“Just as everything began to look
cozy and homelike my pair of Jaspers
decided they were afraid of the ocean,
and, hang me, if they didn’t turn about
and caper back right in the face of the
dancing spearmen. I couldn’t hold
’em, and so I just dropped the cutter
bar and pulled out my junk, only expecting
to muss a few of ’em up before
I was registered. My friends began to
howl behind me, and I tossed a glance
over my shoulder and beheld old
Tiberius coming along after me like a
madman, his machine jumping and
swaying, and he with a big gun in each
hand yelling like a fiend. He had
tossed Her Lordship to the sailors and
was back to play in my drama. Then
the heat of it got into my blood, and as
Tib drew up beside me I gave a war
cry and urged the brutes onward still
faster.</p>

<p>“I knew if we tried to turn we were
down and out, and that our only show
was to put up a bold front and scare
the enemy off the ridge. The sailors
were now popping away merrily, and
just as we had gone the limit the foe
threw up the sponge and scampered
back down the other side of the rise.</p>

<p>“Maybe we were several hours retreating
to the beach! When we got
there the whole bunch fell on Tib’s
neck and pawed his round form affectionately,
the Captain leading in the
demonstration. Tib drove them away,
but when we got aboard and Her Lordship
rushed upon him and throwing both
arms about his neck, pressed her red
lips with a resounding and most plebeian
smack on his chin, you could have heard
him blush. It was the first time I had
ever known him to lose his nerve. He
made a clean break-away and bowing
low said something in a murmur and it
was all over. Of course she thanked
us all, but she realized that Tib was
the guiding light.</p>

<p>“To ring off; we left the machines and
horses for the natives to get up guessing
parties with, and with our machinery
repaired steamed out to the open water.
Tib never made any advances to Her
Lordship after once aboard, although
she eyed him with a soft look whenever
they met on deck during the run to
port.</p>

<p>“‘My old heart got foolish, boy,’ he
remarked to me the night we landed,
‘but it’s beating all right now.’ Yet
he always kept a handkerchief she
dropped.</p>

<p>“And wherever the show played Tib
coined money by the barrel, for Her
Lordship’s people boomed his game
early and late. But Tib got to believing
it was because the show was
so good. For, you see, he’d explain
to me as he counted the receipts,
‘Little Eva is dying better every
night.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Corrupt Practices in Elections</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY HON. LUCIUS F. C. GARVIN<br />
<i>Ex-Governor of Rhode Island</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">EFFORTS to expose bribery and
other corrupt practices in elections
are met with the cry, You
are defaming the state! If there are
governmental evils, we are told, prove
them to the bottom and correct them
quietly. Such a course may be feasible
if applied to a private business,
but in public affairs, in the nature of
the case, it cannot be successful. Certainly
none of the persons who directly
profit by such practices will correct
them—not the “respectable” men of
means who furnish the funds and who
do so with a view to recouping themselves
in some way as a result of the
election; not the workers who handle
the corruption fund, taking good care
to see that they themselves are rewarded
for the trouble and risk involved;
not the individuals who pocket
the money disbursed, and in this way
become always morally, and often
criminally, confederates; nor, finally,
the few who secure the offices through
fraudulent methods. In fact, nothing
has been found effective outside of that
strongest of all influences in a free
country, the force of public opinion.
The many, who are made aware of the
iniquity by suffering from it, have
every inducement to end it.</p>

<p>Over and over again, in great crises,
the American people have shown themselves
to be patriotic, honest and wise.
This has happened whenever the masses
have been aroused by serious threats
of danger, either external or internal.</p>

<p>The real danger to our institutions
lies, not in great crises, but rather in a
gradual, almost insensible, deterioration
of the government, due either to a
lack of vigilance on the part of the
people or to a paralysis of their latent
powers.</p>

<p>While it is possible that the immense
fund of good will and good sense possessed
by the American people may be
expended in private pursuits and thus
diverted from a control of their own
government, the far greater danger is
that the mighty influences being put
forth at almost every election will rupture
completely the natural dependence
of public officials upon the electorate.</p>

<p>In order to cure any wrongdoing it
is needful, first, to ascertain definitely
wherein the wrong consists, and, secondly,
to fix with equal definiteness
upon an adequate remedy.</p>

<p>The crudest, the most demoralizing
and the most common method of withholding
the hands of the sovereign
people from the control of their government
is the direct bribery of voters.
This means of thwarting the wishes of
the majority dates back to the early
history of the country. Our system of
so-called majority election by districts,
placing, as it often does, the balance of
power in a small minority of the electorate,
invites the purchase of the votes
of individuals. It has proved easy
both to estimate the number of votes
needed to turn the scale and to find
out the particular voters who can be so
influenced.</p>

<p>Upon the original plan of buying
individual voters at retail, the improvement
has been made of purchasing <i>en
bloc</i>—the money to be paid over only
in case of delivery of the goods. In
this modern bribery by wholesale the
venal voters organize, choose an agent
to conduct negotiations and sell the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>
entire block of votes to the highest bidder.
When success is achieved, as
shown by the count of the ballots, hundreds
of dollars are paid to the agent
and by him distributed to the members
of the gang.</p>

<p>But, whatever the details of the
transaction, a long experience has
shown that, in a multitude of small
constituencies a few dollars placed in
the hand of a voter are sufficient to
outweigh every consideration of patriotism
or enlightened self-interest.
Wherever this habitually occurs, the
rule of a few moneyed men has been
substituted for a government by the
people.</p>

<p>In the elections of large cities, of
populous states and of the nation at
large, it can seldom happen that bribery
of voters, either by retail or wholesale,
is sufficient to alter the result.
To supply this deficiency other means
are more and more being resorted to.
To assure success, where the number
of voters renders the simpler measure
for overcoming the people’s will unreliable,
party managers now make use
of finesse and fraud.</p>

<p>The finesse consists in “packing” the
primary meetings and conventions of
the rival party for the purpose of nominating
weak opposing candidates.
Nearly every local party may be differentiated
into two factions, both desirous
of success, but the one occupying
morally a very much higher plane than
the other. The rich party, taking advantage
of this division in the ranks
of its opponents, furnishes funds and
votes to aid the baser faction, upon
condition, of course, that, having gained
control of the nomination, candidates
will be put up of such a character as
to drive away the better element from
their support.</p>

<p>In consequence of these manipulations,
when election day comes around,
the poorer party is found with a so-called
“yellow dog” ticket in the field—that
is to say, a ticket composed of
unfit and unknown men, clearly inferior
to the pliant respectabilities who have
been placed in nomination by the richer
party.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that even this
political trick fails to assure success.
Either the better faction of the opposing
party wins, or, notwithstanding
the inferiority of the ticket named, it
may promise to receive a majority of
the votes cast. In this exigency the
managers of the party which is fully
supplied with the sinews of war do
not hesitate at direct fraud. That is
to say, they expend large sums of
money in hiring election officials to
betray their trusts at the risk of going
to jail.</p>

<p>One method adopted, where the law
provides an official ballot, is to get
from the officials having charge of the
ballots one or more to be marked for
the voter by heelers outside of the
polling-room. This furnishes a sure
method of bribery, for the venal voter,
after depositing the ballot thus prepared
for him, returns an unmarked
ballot to the briber, as a guarantee of
good faith, to be marked by him for
the use of the next person bought. In
this way one or more endless chains
of purchased votes may be run all day,
through the connivance of some election
officer. This was done in Pawtucket,
R. I., and at other places in
that state, on the eighth of last
November.</p>

<p>But as the number of venal voters
in a polling precinct is limited, so there
is a limit to the effect attainable by
giving out to heelers the official ballots
designed for use in the voting booth
only.</p>

<p>What more, then, can be done in the
way of modern chicanery and criminality?</p>

<p>Election officers may be bought, and
are bought, to defraud their fellow-citizens
in a variety of ways. For instance,
there is a very considerable percentage
of illiterate voters in most
states, many of whom desire to give
their suffrage to the candidates of one
of the poorer parties. But the richest
party has paid the election officials,
who assist the illiterate voters, to
mark all such ballots for its candidates.
Evidence exists that this was done
systematically at the recent Presidential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
and state election in the city of Providence,
R. I., a sufficient number of
voters thus being deceived to turn the
scale in the filling of one or more important
offices.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as there is a limit to the
number of illiterate voters, even that
base fraud, added to direct bribery,
may not effect the desired reversal of
the people’s will. But the moneyed
party has other resources.</p>

<p>In order to annul votes already cast
for opposing candidates, it may hire
the election officers to make additional
marks upon the ballots before they
are counted. In this way in the city of
Providence, R. I., at the last election
many votes for Augustus S. Meller, the
Democratic candidate for mayor, were
rendered void—fortunately, however,
not in sufficient numbers to prevent
his election.</p>

<p>And not even yet has the corrupted
election officer reached the full extent
of his ability to defraud. It still is
possible for him to miscount votes; or
he may announce the result falsely—for
example, by revising the total number
of votes given to the candidates,
when the real majority proves to be
adverse to his suborned wishes.</p>

<p>In case there is a Returning Board,
whose duty it is to make a second and
final count of the votes cast, as is the
law in the city of Providence and the
state of Rhode Island, that board, too,
or its controlling members, may be
partisan and corrupt.</p>

<p>At the late election in Rhode Island
all the ballots for state officers and
for Presidential electors were in possession
of a partisan Returning Board,
of which the chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee was
the head, for a period of three full
weeks before the counting began. If
there were miscounts in certain voting
districts on election day, it was easily
possible for members of that Returning
Board to open the sealed packages
of ballots, make such changes as were
necessary in order to have the ballots
conform roughly to the previously
announced figures, and then to reseal
without the fraud being detected.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, where are
the courts while such frauds are being
perpetrated? Why are not these criminal
election officers punished? Unfortunately,
the courts, too, are frequently
partisan, especially the lower
courts, before which the cases are first
brought.</p>

<p>After the election of last November
in Rhode Island, three cases were
brought before the inferior courts—one
for bribery, one for posing as an
illiterate voter and one against an
election officer in charge of a ballot-box
for allowing the deposit by voters
of sham instead of official ballots.
Each of these causes was brought before
a different local judge, and all were
thrown out of court. Several days
before election it was known that
immunity had been promised to hesitating
and apprehensive election officers.
“The Republican Party controls
the courts,” they were told, “and
would see that no punishment was
meted out to them for unlawful acts.”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that, if corrupt
practices in elections continue to increase,
the end of popular government
in this country is in sight. Already
there exists a widespread and deep-seated
distrust of the result of elections.
Instances could be given, occurring
within the past ten years, in
which a very large proportion of the
voters interested, perhaps a majority
of those voting, believe that the wrong
candidate was inducted into office.</p>

<p>Certainly no duty is more pressing
than to see to it that in every election
the unbiased and unbought will of the
people be recorded.</p>

<p>Is there a remedy? And, if so, what
is it? My conviction is, that we only
need to carry out the intent of the
founders of this government. They
blazed the way; we must make a clear
and beaten track along that way.</p>

<p>By a republican form of government
the Revolutionary statesmen
meant two things, which now are not
carried out. They meant that every
state, and the nation as well, should
possess a legislative body, representative
of the will of the people. Nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
does this exist, not even where honest
elections assure a free ballot and a fair
count. Neither in ability nor in
opinion do state legislatures by their
acts represent a majority of their constituents,
except by accident. Nor
will they represent the people until
each political party, whether large or
small, elects its due proportion of the
members. That is to say, a party
which casts forty-five per cent. of the
total vote for representatives must
have forty per cent. of the legislature,
and the party which casts five per cent.
of the total vote must have five per cent.
of the legislature. Then only will
statute law be framed in accordance
with the will of a majority of the
people.</p>

<p>The other part of our republican
form of government, as understood and
intended by American statesmen of
the eighteenth century, was that a majority
of the people should directly
control the organic law. To this end
they had the state constitutions framed
by the people, acting through delegates
chosen to conventions for that sole purpose,
but not in effect until submitted
to the electors and adopted by a majority
of the votes cast for and against.
In like manner the referendum was
provided for in case of subsequent
amendments.</p>

<p>It was thought, also, that a popular
initiative for constitutional changes
was created, in the authority given to
legislatures to submit amendments;
but, alas, time has shown that those
legislatures, being unrepresentative of
the people, refuse to submit amendments,
however extensively demanded
by public sentiment.</p>

<p>Hence the necessity of giving the
power to propose constitutional amendments,
as has lately been done in
South Dakota, Utah and Oregon, to a
reasonable minority (in those states
eight per cent.) of the voters. When
the popular initiative shall thus have
been added to the referendum already
existing for making changes in the organic
law of our states, all else will
take care of itself.</p>

<p>The amendment pending in the
Rhode Island Legislature, and known
there as the constitutional initiative,
reads in substance as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Eight per cent. of the legal voters of the
state may propose specific and particular
amendments to this constitution by filing
with the Secretary of State, not less than
three months nor more than nine months
prior to any state election, a petition that
the electors may, at such election, cast their
ballots for or against such amendments.
Any proposition thus made shall be submitted
to the electors by the Secretary of
State at said election, and, if then approved
by a majority of the electors of the state
present and voting thereon, it shall, ninety
days thereafter, become a part of the Constitution
of the state.</p>

<p>To elect a legislature in any state
committed to such an amendment calls
for not only a widespread but an aggressive
public sentiment in its favor.
As a rule the organization of the party
dominant in the state will strenuously
oppose the adoption of the amendment.</p>

<p>A party continuously in power, no
matter what its name or avowed principles,
is sure to frown upon radical
measures. The complete control of the
organic law of a state by a majority of
its voters means a future political situation
hitherto unknown. The effect
upon present party leaders and upon
partisan organizations cannot be foreseen
in full, but that it will be tremendous
no one can doubt.</p>

<p>But if the individuals, who are enjoying
the state offices, are opposed to
a political upheaval of any kind, the
parties which are permanently in the
minority feel very differently. Their
organizations and their members will
welcome any reasonable reform which
promises to alter materially the existing
unsatisfactory situation. Also
in sympathy with a reform so meritorious
and non-partisan would undoubtedly
be found a considerable
portion of the adherents of the dominant
party.</p>

<p>Yet even with a clear majority of the
voters of any state earnestly in favor
of a given amendment to the constitution,
it does not follow that its adoption
would be easy. In every state, with
scarcely an exception, it is the party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
whose membership comprises nine-tenths
of the total wealth, which, with
few brief and partial interruptions,
controls every department of the government.
For the past decade this
has been the situation more than ever
before, and every year finds the power
of money to determine the results of
elections gaining in strength—notwithstanding
a rising public sentiment
against abuses which are ignored, if
not encouraged, by the authorities.</p>

<p>The situation seems almost hopeless,
as is very near being the case, if the
reforming elements pursue for the future
the same course as in the past.</p>

<p>If the leader of the party in power
were permitted to dictate the action of
opponents, his command would be:
“Divide your forces.” Its boss would
say: “Split among yourselves into several
separate and distinct parties, attack
one another with the same virulence
that you attack me. Call yourselves
Democrats, Populists, Socialists,
Prohibitionists, Labor, and have whatever
platforms or principles you please.
In fact, the stronger and nobler the
men and the issues over which the
small parties wave their banners the
better I am pleased, for the more minute
will be the subdivision and the
more attractive and combative each
fractional part.”</p>

<p>And these hopelessly minor parties
offer few inducements to the dissatisfied
members of the major party to
change their political affiliations. Such
a transfer is altogether too much like
removing one’s bed on a bitter cold
night from a warm room to a vacant
lot. Discomforts, and even hardships,
patriotic citizens may be willing to endure,
but they can scarcely be blamed
for refusing to embrace them merely
for the fun of being come-outers.</p>

<p>In order to contend successfully
against the party in power, however
well known its abuses, there must be a
co-operation of the dissatisfied and antagonistic
voters. By co-operation it
is not meant that an attempt should be
made to create a single party with a
platform composed of the planks of
half a dozen parties. Such a composite
is but a rope of sand; and, in fact, the
stringing together of a collection of unrelated
questions, such as prohibition,
socialism and labor, is quite as likely to
end in mutual hostilities as in a combined
charge upon the common enemy.</p>

<p>The use of money for carrying a
state election by corrupt practices can
only be offset by the exercise of great
wisdom on the part of those who depend
upon other agencies. The second
party, which in the Northern states
generally means the Democratic, must
furnish the nucleus about which the
third, fourth and fifth parties gather.
Indeed, it devolves upon the second
party to invite the other minor parties
to join forces with it. And, in order
to have such invitation accepted, it
must fix upon one or two paramount
issues so fundamental and important
as to attract strongly all who are offended
with the doings of the party
in power. If two issues are elected,
one of them may well be a constitutional
amendment such as has been
outlined in this article, the other might
be a legislative measure—such, for instance,
as direct primaries, which serve
excellently the purpose of a corrupt
practices act.</p>

<p>Each of the minor parties, besides
educational work, wishes to preserve
its organization and to measure its
strength at each succeeding election by
the number of votes cast in its support.
The wish is natural and proper; but
the objects aimed at can be accomplished
in a state election without putting
full tickets into the field. The
nomination and support of a single
candidate for a minor state office will
fully answer both purposes.</p>

<p>The means of stopping most surely
and speedily corrupt practices by the
party in power, lies in an open and
aboveboard fusion of all its opponents
upon a few issues, together with a
united support of one set of candidates
for all offices whose incumbents can aid
or hinder the adoption of the measures
agreed upon. This, I believe, offers
the best chance of accomplishing the
very difficult task of establishing in a
state good and pure government.</p>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY WILL N. HARBEN<br />

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE planter alighted from the
dusty little train under the
crumbling brick car-shed at
Darley, turned his heavy hand-luggage
over to the negro porter and
walked across the grass to the steps
of the Johnston House. Here he was
met by Jim Thornton, the dapper
young clerk, who always had a curled
mustache and hair smoothed flatly
down over his brow.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are, right side up,
Captain Duncan!” he cried. “You
can’t stay away from those level
acres of yours very long at a time.”</p>

<p>“No, Jim.” The short, thick-set man
smiled as he took the extended hand.
“As soon as I heard spring had opened
up here we left Florida. I had a bad
case of homesickness. My wife and
daughter came a week ago. I had to
stop on business in Jacksonville. I
always want to be here in planting
season; my men never seem to know
exactly what I want done when I am
away. Jim, I’ve got a lot of land out
there between the river and the mountains.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you have,” laughed the
clerk as he led his guest into the hotel
office. “There’s a neighbor of yours
over there at the stove, old Tom
Mayhew, who runs the big store—Mayhew
&amp; Floyd’s—at Springtown.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know him mighty well,”
said Duncan. “How are you, Mayhew?
What are you doing away from
your beat? I thought you’d be behind
your counter such fine weather as this.”</p>

<p>“Trade’s dull,” said the merchant,
who was a tall, spare-made man about
sixty-five years of age, with iron-gray
hair and beard. “Farmers are all at
the plow, and that’s where they
ought to be if they expect to pay
anything on their debts this fall. I
had to lay in some stock, and so I ran
down to Atlanta day before yesterday.
My young partner, Nelson Floyd,
usually does the replenishing, but the
books got out of whack, and I left him
to tussle with them; he’s got a better
head for figures than I have. I’ve just
sent to the livery-stable for a horse
and buggy to take me out; how are you
going?”</p>

<p>“Why, I hardly know,” answered
the planter as he took off his straw
hat and wiped his bald head with a
silk handkerchief. “I telegraphed
Lawson, my head overseer, to send
somebody to meet me, and I was just
wondering——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll be attended to all
right, Captain Duncan!” said the
clerk, with a laugh as he stood at the
register behind the counter. “Pole
Baker was in here last night asking if
you had arrived. He said he had
brought a buggy and was going to
drive you back. You will make it all
right if Pole sobers up long enough to
get out of town. He was thoroughly
‘how-come-you-so’ last night. He was
in Askew’s bar raising holy Cain.
The marshal ordered Billy to close at
twelve, but Pole wouldn’t hear to it,
and they were within an inch of having
a fight. I believe they would if
Mrs. Johnston hadn’t heard them and
come down. Pole has more respect for
women than most men, and as soon
as he saw her at the door he hushed up
and went to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“He’s as straight as a shingle this
morning, Captain,” put in Charlie
Smith, a mulatto porter, who was
rolling a pair of trucks across the room
laden with a drummer’s enormous
brass-bound trunk. “He was up
before day asking if you got in durin’
the night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he’s sobered up if
he’s to take me out,” said the planter.
“He’s about the biggest daredevil
out our way. You know him, don’t
you, Mayhew?”</p>

<p>“Know him? Humph! to the extent
of over three hundred dollars. Floyd
thinks the sun rises and sets in him
and never will close down on him.
They are great friends. Floyd will
fight for him at the drop of a hat. He
says Pole has more manhood in him
to the square inch than any man in the
county, white or black. He saw him
in a knock-down-and-drag-out row in
the public square last election. They
say Pole whipped three bigger men
than he is all in a bunch, and bare-handed
at that. Nobody knows to this
day how it started. Nelson doesn’t,
but I heard it was some remark one of
the fellows made about Nelson himself.
You know my partner had a rather
strange start in life—a poor boy with
nobody to see to his bringing up, but
that’s a subject that his best friends
don’t mention to him.”</p>

<p>The Captain nodded understandingly.
“They tell me Pole used to be
a moonshiner,” he said, “and I have
heard that he was the shrewdest one
in the mountains. His wife got him
to quit it. I understand he fairly worships
the ground she walks on, and
there never was a better father to his
children.”</p>

<p>“He thinks well enough of them
when he’s at himself,” said Mayhew,
“but when he’s drinking he neglects
them awfully. I’ve known the neighbors
to feed them two weeks on a
stretch. He’s got enemies out our way.
When he quit moonshining he helped
some of the government officers find
some stills over there. That was funny.
Pole held off from the job that was
offered him for a month, during which
time he sent word everywhere through
the mountains that he would give all
his old friends plenty of time to shut
up and quit making whisky, but after
his month was up he intended to do
all he could against law-breakers. He
had to testify against several, and they
now certainly have it in for him. He’d
have been shot long ago if his enemies
weren’t afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“I see him coming now, Mr. Mayhew,”
said the clerk. “Captain, he
walks steady enough. I reckon he’ll
take you through safe.”</p>

<p>The tall countryman, about thirty-five
years of age, without a coat, his
coarse cotton shirt open at the neck,
a slouch hat on his massive head
and his tattered trousers stuffed into
the tops of his high boots, came in. He
had a brown, sweeping mustache, and
his eyebrows were unusually heavy.
On the heel of his right foot he
wore an old riding-spur, very loosely
strapped.</p>

<p>“How are you, Captain Duncan?” he
said to the planter as he extended his
brawny hand. “You’ve come back to
God’s country, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Baker,” the planter returned
with a genial smile; “I had to see what
sort of chance you fellows stand for a
crop this year. I understand Lawson
sent you over for me and my baggage.
I’m certainly glad he engaged a man
about whom I have heard such good
reports.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that,
Captain,” said Pole, his bushy brows
meeting in a frown of displeasure and
his dark eyes flashing. “I don’t know
as I’m runnin’ a hack-line, or totin’
trunks about for the upper-ten set of
humanity. I’m a farmer myself, in a
sort of way—smaller’n you are, but a
farmer. I was comin’ this way yesterday,
and was about to take my own
hoss out o’ the field, where he had
plenty to do, when Lawson said, said
he, ‘Baker, bein’ as you are goin’ to
make the trip anyways, I’d feel under
obligations ef you’d take my rig and
fetch Captain Duncan back when you
come.’ By gum, to tell you the truth,
I’ve just come in to tell you, old hoss,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
if you are ready right now, we’ll ride
out together, if not I’ll leave you
an’ go out with Nathan Porter. Engaged,
the devil! I’m not goin’ to get
any money out o’ this job.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I meant no offense at all,
Baker,” said the planter in no little
embarrassment, for the group was
smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you didn’t,” said
Pole, slightly mollified, “but it’s always
a good idea fer two men to know
exactly where they stand, and I’m
here to say I don’t take off my hat to
no man on earth.”</p>

<p>“That’s the right spirit,” Duncan
said admiringly. “Now, I’m ready
if you are, and it’s time we were on
the move. Those two valises are mine
and that big overcoat tied in a bundle.”</p>

<p>“Here, Charlie!” Pole called out to
the porter, “put them things o’ Duncan’s
in the back end o’ the buggy, an’
I’ll throw you a dime the next time
I’m in town.”</p>

<p>“All right, boss,” the mulatto said,
with a knowing wink and smile at
Mayhew. “They’ll be in by the time
you get there.”</p>

<p>While the planter was at the counter,
saying good-bye to the clerk, Pole
looked down at Mayhew. “When are
<i>you</i> goin’ out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In an hour or so,” answered the
merchant as he spat into a cuspidor.
“I’m waiting now for a turnout, and
I’ve got some business to attend to.”</p>

<p>“Collections to make, I’ll bet my
hat,” Pole laughed. “I thought mighty
few folks was out on Main Street jest
now; they know you are abroad in the
land an’ want to save the’r socks.”</p>

<p>“Do you reckon that’s it, Pole?”
said Mayhew as he spat again. “I
thought maybe it was because they was
afraid you’d paint the town, and
wanted to keep their skins whole.”</p>

<p>The clerk and the planter laughed.
“He got you that time, Baker,” the
latter said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’ll acknowledge the corn,” and
the mountaineer joined in the laugh
good-naturedly. “To look at the old
skinflint, settin’ half asleep all the time,
a body wouldn’t think his tongue had
any life to it. I’ve seed the dern thing
wiggle before, but it was mostly when
thar was a trade up.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>As they were driving into the country
road, just beyond the straggling houses
in the outskirts of the town, going toward
the mountains, which lay along
the western horizon like blue clouds
nestling against the earth, the planter
said:</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you fishing and hunting
with Mayhew’s young partner, Nelson
Floyd. You and he are rather intimate,
are you not?”</p>

<p>“Jest about as friendly as two men
can be,” said Pole, “when one’s rising
in the world an’ t’other is eternally at
a standstill, or goin’ down like a round
rock on the side of a mountain. Or
maybe, I ought to say, when one of
’em has had the pluck to educate hisself
an’ t’other hardly knows B from a
bull’s foot. I don’t know, Captain,
why Nelson Floyd’s friendly to me. I
like him beca’se he is a man from his
toe-nails to the end o’ the longest hair
on his head.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard a lot of good things
about him,” remarked the planter,
“and I understand, too, that he has
his faults.”</p>

<p>“They’re part of his manhood,”
said Pole philosophically. “Show me
a feller without faults and I’ll show
you one that’s too weak to have ’em.
Nelson’s got some o’ the dust o’ the
broad road on his coat, an’ yet I’d take
his place in the general bust-up when
old Gabe blows his trumpet at the millennium
a sight quicker than I’d stand
in the shoes o’ some o’ these jack-leg
preachers. I tell you, Captain Duncan,
ef the Lord’s goin’ to make favorites
o’ some o’ the long-face hypocrites I
know, that is robbin’ widows an’
orphans in the week an’ prayin’ an’
shoutin’ on Sunday to pull the wool
over folkses’ eyes, me an’ Him won’t gee
in the hereafter. You know some’n
about that boy’s start in life, don’t you,
Captain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“Not much, I must own,” answered
the planter.</p>

<p>“Thar it is!” said Pole, with a condemning
sneer; “ef the pore boy had
belonged to one o’ the big families in
yore ring out in Murray—the high an’
mighty sort, that owned niggers, you’d
’a’ heard all about him. Captain, nobody
on earth knows how that feller
has suffered. All his life he’s wanted
to make some’n of hisself an’ has
absolutely to my certain knowledge
had more to contend with than any
man alive today. He don’t even know
the exact date of his birth, an’ ain’t
plumb sure that his name really is
Floyd. You see, jest at the close of the
war a woman—so sick she could hardly
walk—come through the Union lines
in East Tennessee with a baby in her
arms. The report is that she claimed
that her name was Floyd, an’ that she
called the baby ‘Nelson.’ She put up
at a mountain cabin for the night, a
shack where some pore razor-back
whites lived by the name o’ Perdue.
Old man Perdue was a lyin’, treacherous
scamp, a bushwhacker and a
mountain outlaw, an’ his wife was a
good mate to him. Nelson’s mammy,
as I say, was tuck in, but thar wasn’t
no doctor nigh, an’ very little to eat,
an’ the next mornin’ she was ravin’ out
of her head, and late that day she died.
I’m tellin’ you now all that Nelson
Floyd ever was able to find out, as it
came down to him from one person’s
recollection to another’s. Well, the
woman was buried som’ers, nobody
knows whar, an’ old Mrs. Perdue kept
the baby more beca’se she was afeared to
put it out o’ the way than fer any pity
fer it. She had a whole litter of brats of
her own goin’ about winter an’ summer
in the’r shirt-tails, an’ so they left
Nelson to scratch fer hisself. Then
the authorities made it hot fer Perdue
on some charges agin ’im, and he left
the child with another pore mountain
family by name o’ Scott and moved
clean out o’ the country. The Scotts
couldn’t remember much more than
hearsay about how Nelson got thar an’
they didn’t care, though they tried to
raise the boy along with three of their
own. He had a tough time of it, for
he was a plucky little devil and had a
fight mighty nigh every day with somebody.
And as he growed up he naturally
fell into bad company, or it fell
into him, like everything else did, an’
he tuck to drinkin’ an’ become a regular
young outlaw; he was a bloodthirsty
rowdy before he was fifteen;
shot at one man fer some cause or
other an’ barely escaped bein’ put up
fer life—nothin’ but bein’ so young
got ’im off. But one day—now I’m
givin’ it to you jest as Nelson told me—one
day he said he got to thinkin’
about the way he was a-goin’, and of his
own accord he made up his mind to
call a halt. He wanted to cut clean off
from his old set, an’ so he went to
Mayhew and told him he wanted to git
work in the store. Old Mayhew would
skin a flea fer its hide an’ tallow, an’
seein’ his money in the boy, he bound
’im to an agreement to work fer his
bare board an’ clothes fer three
years.”</p>

<p>“Low enough wages, certainly!”
exclaimed the planter.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Nelson didn’t grumble,
and Mayhew will tell you hisself that
thar never was sech a worker sence the
world was made. He was a general
hand at ever’thing, and as bright as
a new dollar and as quick as a steel
trap. The Lord only knows when or
how he did it, fer nobody ever seed a
book in his hands in business hours,
but he l’arned to read and write and
figure. An’ that wasn’t all. Mayhew
was sech an old skinflint, and so
hard on folks who got in his debt, that
nobody traded at his shebang except
them that couldn’t go anywhars else;
but lo and behold! Nelson made so
many friends that they flocked around
’im from all directions an’ the business
of the house was more than doubled at
a jump. Mayhew knowed the cause of
it, fer lots o’ customers throwed it up
to ’im. The prosperity was almost too
much fer the old skunk; in fact, he got
mighty nigh scared at it and actually
tried to dam the stream o’ profit. To
keep up such a business big credit had
to be extended, and it was a new venture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
fer the cautious old scamp. But
Nelson had perfect faith in all his
friends, and thar it stood—a beardless
boy holdin’ forth that it was the old
man’s chance fer a lifetime to git rich,
and old Mayhew half believin’ it,
crazy to act on Nelson’s judgment, an’
yet afraid it would be ruination. That
was at the close of the boy’s three-year
contract. He was then about twenty
year old, and I was in the store and
heard the talk between ’em. We was
all a-settin’ at the big wood stove in
the back end, me an’ the old man, an’
Nelson and Joe Peters, a clerk, who
is still with the firm. I shall never
forgit that night as long as I live.
I gloried in the boy’s spunk to sech
an extent I could ’a’ throwed up my
hat an’ hollered.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve been waitin’ to have a talk
with you, Mr. Mayhew,’ Nelson said.
‘Our contract is out today, and you
an’ me disagree so much about runnin’
the business that I hardly know what
I ought to do an’ not stand in my own
light. We’ve got to make a fresh contract
anyway.’</p>

<p>“‘I knowed that was comin’,’ old
Mayhew said, with one o’ his big,
hoggish grunts. ‘People for miles
around have made it the’r particular
business to fill you up with ideas about
what you are wuth. I’ve thought some
about lettin’ you go an’ see ef me an’
Joe cayn’t keep things a-movin’, but
you know the trade round here, an’ I
want to do the fair thing. What do
you think yore time’s wuth?’” Pole
laughed. “The old skunk was usin’
exactly the same words he’d ’a’ used
ef he was startin’ in to buy a load o’
produce an’ wanted to kill expectation
at the outset.</p>

<p>“‘I want fifty dollars a month, under
certain conditions,’ the boy said, lookin’
the old skinflint straight in the
eye.</p>

<p>“‘Fifty—huh! yo’re crazy, stark’
starin’ crazy—plumb off yore base!’
the old man said, his lip twisted up
like it is when he’s mad. ‘I see myse’f
payin’ a beardless boy a Broadway
salary to work in a shack like this out
here in the mountains.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ll jest be obliged to quit
you then,’ Nelson said as steady as
a millpond on a hot day in August,
’an’ I’d sorter hate to do it. Moore &amp;
Trotter, at Darley, offer me that fer
the fust six months, with an increase
later.’</p>

<p>“‘Moore &amp; Trotter!’ the old skunk
grunted loud enough to be heard clean
to the court-house. They was the only
firm in this end o’ the state that controlled
as much custom as Mayhew
did, an’ it struck the old chap under
the ribs. He got up from his chair an’
walked clean down to the front door.
It was shet an’ locked, but thar was a
lamp on the show-case nigh whar he
stopped, an’ I could see his old face
a-workin’ under the influence o’ good
an’ evil. Purty soon he grunted, an’
come back, thumpin’ his old stick agin
barrels an’ boxes along the way.</p>

<p>“‘How am I goin’ to know whether
they offered you that much or not?’
he axed.</p>

<p>“‘Beca’se I said so,’ Nelson told
’im, an’ his dark eyes was flashin’ like
lightnin’. He stood up an’ faced the
old codger. ‘I’ll tell you one thing,
Mr. Mayhew,’ he let fly at ’im, ’ef
you don’t know whether I’m tellin’
the truth or not you’d better let me
go, fer a man that will lie will steal.
I say they offered me fifty dollars.
I’ve got the’r written proposition in
my pocket, but I’ll be hanged ef I
show it to you.’”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Duncan.</p>

<p>“Well, it knocked the old man clean
off his feet,” Pole went on. “He sat
down in his chair again, all of a
tremble an’ white about the mouth.
Stingy people git scared to death at
the very idea o’ payin’ out money,
anyway, an’ stingy don’t fit that old
cuss. Ef Noah Webster had known
him he’d ’a’ made another word fer that
meanin’. I don’t know but he’d simply
’a’ spelled out the old man’s name an’
’a’ been done with it.”</p>

<p>“What answer did Mayhew give the
young man, Baker?” asked the planter
in a tone which indicated no little interest.</p>

<p>“Why, he jest set still for awhile,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
said Pole, “an’ me an’ Joe Peters was
a-wonderin’ what he’d say. He never
did do anything sudden. Ef he ever
gits thar he’ll feel his way through
heaven’s gate. I seed ’im keep a
woman standin’ in the store once from
breakfast to dinner-time while he was
lookin’ fer a paper o’ needles she’d
called fer. Every now an’ then he’d
quit huntin’ fer the needles an’ go an’
wait on some other customer, an’ then
come back to ’er. She was a timid
sort o’ thing, an’ didn’t seem to think
she had the right to leave, bein’ as she
had started the search. Whenever
she’d go towards the door to see ef her
hoss was standin’, he’d call ’er back
an’ ax ’er about ’er crap an’ tell ’er
not to be in a hurry—that Rome wasn’t
built in a day, an’ the like. You know
the old cuss has some education.
Finally he found the needles an’ tuck
another half an hour to select a scrap
o’ paper little enough to wrap ’em up in.
But you axed me what Mayhew said to
’im. You bet the boy was too good a
trader to push a matter like that to a
head. He’d throwed down the bars, an’
he jest waited fer the old man to go
through of his own accord. Finally
Mayhew axed, as indifferent as he
could under all his excitement,
‘When do you intend to answer the
letter you say you got from Moore &amp;
Trotter?’</p>

<p>“‘I’ve already answered it,’ Nelson
said. ‘I told ’em I appreciated the’r
offer an’ would run over an’ see ’em
day after tomorrow.’”</p>

<p>“Good, very well said, Baker!”
laughed Captain Duncan. “No wonder
the young man’s become rich. You
can’t keep talent like that down. But
what did old Mayhew say?”</p>

<p>“It was like pullin’ eye-teeth,” answered
Pole, “but he finally come
across. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘I reckon you
kin make yorese’f as useful to me as
you kin to them, an’ ef you are bent on
ridin’ me to death, after I picked you
up an’ give you a start an’ l’arnt
you how to do business, I reckon I’ll
have to put up with it.’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t feel like I owe you anything,’
said Nelson as plucky as a
banker demandin’ good security on a
loan. ‘I’ve worked for you like a slave
for three years for my bare livin’ an’
my experience, an’ from now on I am
goin’ to work for Number One. I said
that I’d stay for fifty dollars a month
on certain conditions.’</p>

<p>“‘Conditions?’ the old man growled.
‘What conditions do you mean?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, it’s jest this,’ said Nelson.
‘I’ve had my feelin’s, an’ the feelin’s o’
my friends, hurt time after time by you
turnin’ folks off without credit when
I knowed they would meet the’r obligations.
Now, ef I stay with you it is
with the distinct understandin’ that
I have the authority to give or refuse
credit whenever I see fit.’</p>

<p>“That knocked the old man off his
perch agin. He wilted an’ sat thar as
limp as a dish-rag. Joe Peters worships
the ground Nelson walks on, an’
as ’feard as he was o’ the old man, he
busted out in a big chuckle, an’ rubbed
his hands together. Besides he knowed
the boy was talkin’ fer the interest o’
the business. He’d seed no end o’ good
customers sent off fer no reason in the
world than that Mayhew was scared o’
his shadow.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll never consent to <i>that!</i>’ Mayhew
said, mighty nigh clean whipped
out.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Moore &amp; Trotter <i>will</i>,’ Nelson
said. ‘That’s one o’ the things laid
down in the’r proposition.’ An’ the
boy went to the desk an’ drawed out a
sheet o’ paper an’ dipped his pen in the
ink. The old man set quivering awhile,
an’ then got up an’ went an’ stood behind
the boy. ‘Put down yore pen,’
said he, with a sigh from away down
inside of ’im. ‘It would ruin me fer
you to go to Darley—half the trade
would follow you. Go ahead; I’ll keep
you an’ run the risk.’”</p>

<p>The planter had been listening attentively,
and he now said admiringly:
“Even at that early age the boy was
showing what developed later. It
wasn’t long after that before he became
the old man’s partner, I believe.”</p>

<p>“The next year,” answered Pole.
“He saved every dollar of his wages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
and made some good investments that
turned out money. It wasn’t a big
slice of the business at fust, but he now
owns a half, an’, countin’ his outside
interests, he’s wuth a great deal more
than old Mayhew. He’s rich already,
Captain.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard the women say,”
smiled the planter. “Women always
keep track of well-to-do unmarried
men.”</p>

<p>“It hain’t spiled Nelson one bit,
though,” added Baker. “He’s the
same unselfish friend to me as he ever
was, and I hain’t hardly got a roof to
cover me an’ mine. But, as solid as he
always was, he had a serious back-set
about three years ago, and all his well-wishers
thought it was goin’ to do him
up.”</p>

<p>“You mean when he took to drinking,”
said Captain Duncan interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I mean. He’d
formed the habit when he was a boy,
and, along with his prosperity an’ late
work hours, it begun to fasten its claws
on ’im like it has on some other folks
I know, Captain. He had a lot o’ night
work to do, an’ Thigpen’s bar was right
j’inin’ the store. Nelson used to slide in
at the back door whenever the notion
struck ’im, and he made the trail hot,
I tell you. Old Mayhew kept a sharp
eye on ’im, an’ ever’ now and then he’d
git powerful blue over the way things
was a-goin’. Finally the old cuss got
desperate an’ called a halt. He had a
straight talk with Nelson, an’ told ’im
they would have to divide the’r
interests, that he wasn’t a drinkin’
man hisse’f, an’ he didn’t want to be
yoked to one that was soaked half the
time. It fetched the boy to his senses.
He come over to my house that night
an’ called me out to the fence.</p>

<p>“‘I want to make a deal with you,
Pole,’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘With me?’ says I. ‘What sort of
a deal?’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ said he, ‘I’ve made up my
mind to swear off fer good an’ all, an’
I want you to j’ine me.’</p>

<p>“I agreed all right,” Pole laughed.
“In fact, I was sorter in that business.
I’d promised every preacher an’ temperance
worker in the county to quit,
an’ I couldn’t refuse a friend what I
was dispensin’ so freely right an’ left.
So I said, said I, ‘All right, Nelson;
I’m with you.’”</p>

<p>“And how did it come out?” questioned
the planter as he bowed to a
wagon full of farmers going in an opposite
direction.</p>

<p>“His vaccination tuck,” Pole smiled.
“He had a mighty sore arm fer a week
or so, but he held out. As fer me, I
was so dern glad to see his success in
abstainin’ that I started in to celebrate.
I did try at fust, though. One mornin’
I went in the store an’ seed Nelson have
sech a clean, prosperous look an’ so well
satisfied with his stand that I went out
with fresh resolutions. What did I do?
I went to the barroom an’ bought four
pint bottles o’ red rye an’ tuck ’em
home with me. I set ’em all in a
straight row on the mantel-shelf, nigh
the edge, in front o’ the clock, an’ was
standin’ lookin’ at ’em when Sally, my
wife, come in. She seed the display
an’ jest set kerflop down in her chair
an’ begun to whimper.</p>

<p>“‘You hold on,’ said I; ‘don’t you
cross a foot-log till the tree’s down.
I’m tryin’ a new dicker. I’ve always
heard that familiarity breeds contempt,
an’ I’ve also heard that the hair
o’ the dog is good fer the bite. Now,
I’ve tried my level best to quit liquor
by stayin’ away from it an’ I’m a-goin’
to see ef I cayn’t do it with its red eye
on me all the time.’ Well, Captain, the
sweet little woman—she’s a sweet, dear
little creature, Captain Duncan, ef I
do say it myself.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always heard so, Baker,” the
planter said. “She’s very popular
with your neighbors.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’m jest t’other way,” said
Pole. “Well, Sally, she got up an’
kissed me, an’ said that somehow she
felt like my plan would work.”</p>

<p>“And did it—I mean,” the Captain
recalled Pole’s spree of only the night
before, “I mean did it work for any
length of time?”</p>

<p>“I was goin’ on to tell you,” answered
the mountaineer. “That night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
fer the fust time sence my marriage I
woke smack dab in the middle o’ the
night, an’ as I laid thar in the room
filled with moonlight I couldn’t see
a blessed thing but that row o’ bottles,
an’ then my mouth set in to waterin’
at sech a rate that I got afeard I’d
ketch my death from sleepin’ on a wet
pillow. It was certainly a struggle
with the flesh. I’d put my thirst,
when she’s good an’ dry, agin any that
ever tickled a human throat. It ’ud
take the blue ribbon at a state fair.
It’s a rail thing; it kin walk an’ talk
an’ kick an’ squirm, but it won’t be
dictated to. Finally Sally woke up
an’ said:</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter, Pole? Hain’t
you comfortable?’</p>

<p>“‘Comfortable, the devil!’ said I. I’m
usually polite to Sally, but I felt like
that wasn’t no time an’ place to talk
about little matters. ‘Comfortable,
nothin’,’ said I; ‘Sally, ef you don’t
take that “dog-hair” out o’ this house
an’ hide it, I’ll be as drunk as a b’iled
owl in ten minutes.’</p>

<p>“’“Dog-hair?”’ said she, an’ then the
little woman remembered an’ got up.
I heard the bottles tinkle like sorrowful
good-bye bells callin’ wanderin’
friends back to the fold as she tuck ’em
up an’ left. Captain, I felt jest like”—Pole
laughed good-naturedly—“I felt
like thar was a plot agin the best
friends I ever had. I actually felt
sorry fer them bottles, an’ I got up
an’ stood at the window an’ watched
Sally as she tuck ’em away out in the
lonely moonlight to the barn. I seed
’er climb over the fence o’ the cow-lot
an’ go in the side whar I kept my hay
an’ fodder an’ roughness fer my cattle.
Then I laid down in bed agin.”</p>

<p>“That was certainly a courageous
thing to do,” said the planter, “and
you deserve credit for putting your
foot down so firmly on what you felt
was so injurious, even, even—” the
Captain came back again to reality—“even
if you did not remain firm very
long afterward.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you one thing,” the
ex-moonshiner laughed again, and his
eyes twinkled in subtle enjoyment,
“it tuck Sally longer, it seemed to me,
to git to sleep after she got back than
it ever had in all her life. Of all times
on earth she wanted to talk. But I
shet ’er off. I made like I was breathin’
good an’ deep an’ then she set in
too. What did I do? Captain Duncan,
I spent the best half o’ that night
out in the barn lookin’ fer hens’ nests.
I found two an’ had to be put to bed
at sun-up.”</p>

<p>The planter laughed heartily.
“There is one good thing about the
situation, Baker,” he said, “and that
is, your making a joke of it. I believe
you will get the under-hold on the
thing some day and throw it over.
Coming back to your friend Floyd; it’s
a fact that he gave up whisky, but if
reports are true, he has another fault
that is almost as bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean all that talk about
Jeff Wade’s sister,” answered the
mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Yes, Baker, a reputation of that
sort is not a desirable thing in any
community. I know that many brainy
and successful men hold that kind of
thing lightly, but it will down anybody
who tampers with it.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Captain,” Pole
said sharply, “don’t you be plumb
foolish! Ain’t you got more sense
’an to swallow everything that
passes amongst idle women in these
mountains? Nelson Floyd, I’ll admit,
has got a backbone full o’ the
fire o’ youth an’ strong-blooded manhood,
but he’s, to my positive knowledge,
one o’ the cleanest young men I
ever come across. To tell you the
truth, I don’t believe he ever made
but that one slip. It got out, an’
beca’se he was rich an’ prominent, it
raised a regular whirlwind o’ gossip
an’ exaggeration. If the same thing
had happened to half a dozen other
young men round about here, not a
word would ’a’ been said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” smiled the planter.
“He’s not as black as he’s painted,
then?”</p>

<p>“Not by a jugful!” said the farmer.
“I tell you he’s all right, Captain, an’
folks will know it ’fore long.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>Springtown was about twelve miles
west of Darley, only a mile from
Captain Duncan’s house, and half a
mile from Pole Baker’s humble cottage
and small farm. The village had
a population of about two hundred
souls. It was the county seat; and
the court-house, a simple, ante-bellum
brick structure, stood in the centre of
the public square, round which were
clustered the one-storied shops, lawyers’
offices, cotton warehouses, hotel
and general stores.</p>

<p>Chief among the last mentioned was
the well-known establishment of Mayhew
&amp; Floyd. It was a long frame
building, once white but now a murky
gray, a tone which nothing but the
brush of time and weather could have
given it.</p>

<p>It was only a week since Captain
Duncan’s talk with Pole Baker, and a
bright, inspiring morning, well suited
to the breaking of the soil and the
planting of seed. The village was agog
with the spirit of hope. The post-office
was filled with men who had
come for their mail, and they stood
and chatted about the crops on the
long veranda of the hotel and in the
front part of Mayhew &amp; Floyd’s store.
Pole Baker was in the store talking
with Joe Peters, the clerk, about seed-potatoes,
when a tall countryman in
the neighborhood of forty-five years of
age slouched in and leaned heavily
against the counter.</p>

<p>“I want a box o’ forty-four cartridges,”
he said, drawing out a long
revolver and rapping on the counter
with the butt of it.</p>

<p>“What! you goin’ squirrel huntin’?”
Peters laughed and winked at Pole.
“That gun’s got a long enough barrel
to reach the top o’ the highest tree in
these mountains.”</p>

<p>“You slide around behind thar an’
git me them cartridges!” retorted the
customer. “Do yore talkin’ to somebody
else. I’ll hunt what an’ whar
I want to, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off yore perch, Jeff
Wade!” the clerk said, with another
easy laugh. “You hain’t nobody’s
daddy. But here you are. Forty
cents a box, full count, every one warranted
to make a hole an’ a noise.
Want me to charge ’em?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t; by God—I don’t! An’
what’s more, I want to know exactly
how much I owe this house. I went
to a dozen money lenders ’fore I found
what I wanted, but I got it an’ I want
to pay what I owe Mayhew &amp; Floyd.”</p>

<p>Just then Pole Baker stepped up to
the man’s side and, peering under the
broad brim of his hat, said:</p>

<p>“Looky here, Jeff Wade, what you
shootin’ off yore mouth fer? I ’lowed
at fust that you was full, but you
hain’t drinkin’; at least, you don’t
seem that way to me.”</p>

<p>“Drinkin’, hell! No, I’m not drinkin’,
an’ what’s more, I don’t intend to
let a drap pass down my throat till
I’ve done my duty to me an’ mine.
Say, you look an’ see ef I’m drinkin’.
See ef you think a man that’s in liquor
would have as steady a nerve as I’ve
got. You watch me! Maybe it’ll
show you what I’m able to do.”</p>

<p>Turning, he stalked out of the store,
and Peters and Pole followed, watching
him in wonder. He strode across the
street to the court-house, loading his
revolver as he went. Reaching the
closed door of the public building he
took an envelope from his pocket and
fastened it to the panel by thrusting
the blade of his big pocket-knife into
it several times. The spectators heard
the hollow, resounding blows like the
strokes of a carpenter’s hammer, and
then Wade turned and came back toward
them.</p>

<p>“By gum, he’s off his nut!” said
Peters seriously. “He’s as crazy as a
bedbug.”</p>

<p>“It’s my opinion he’s jest comin’ to
his senses,” Pole mused, a thoughtful
look in his eyes. “Yes, that’s about
it; he’s jest wakin’ up, an’ the whole
county will know it, too. By gum, I
hate this—I hate it!”</p>

<p>“You hate what?” asked Peters, his
eyes on the farmer, who was now quite
near them. Pole made no reply, for
Wade was by his side on the brick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
walk beneath the wooden shed in front
of the store, his revolver swinging at
his side.</p>

<p>“You fellows keep yore eye on that
envelope,” said Wade, and he cocked
his revolver.</p>

<p>“Look here, don’t make a dern fool
o’ yorese’f,” said Pole Baker, and he
laid a remonstrating hand on the tense
arm of the gaunt mountaineer. “You
know it’s agin the ordinance. You
know you’ll git into trouble; you listen
to the advice of a friend. Put that
gun up an’ go home.”</p>

<p>“I’m my own boss!” snarled the
man with the weapon.</p>

<p>“You’re a blamed fool too,” answered
Baker.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s my lookout.” Wade
glared over his shoulder and raised
his voice significantly: “I want to show
this town how easy it will be fer me
to put three balls into the blackest
heart that ever pumped human blood.”</p>

<p>“You’d better mind what yo’re
about, Jeff Wade.” Pole Baker was
pale, his lips were tight, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“I know what I’m about. I’m tryin’
to draw a coward from his lair.
I’m not shore—I’m not <i>dead</i> shore,
mind you, but I’m mighty nigh it. Ef
the guilty stand an’ hear what I’m
a-sayin’ an’ don’t take it up, they are
wuss than hell-tainted. You watch
that white mark.”</p>

<p>The bystanders, several comprehending,
stood rigid. Pole Baker
stared. Wade raised his revolver,
aimed steadily at the mark and fired
three shots in quick succession.</p>

<p>“Thar!” said the marksman, with
grim triumph, “as bad as my sight is,
I kin see ’em from here.”</p>

<p>“By gum, they are thar!” exclaimed
Peters, with a strange look into Pole
Baker’s set face. “They are thar,
Pole.”</p>

<p>“You bet they are thar, an’ some’ll
be in another spot ’fore long,” said
Wade. “Now, Peters, you go in the
house an’ bring me my account. I’ve
got the money.”</p>

<p>Wonderingly the clerk obeyed. Pole
went into the store behind him, and,
as Peters stood at the big ledger figuring,
Pole stepped up to Nelson Floyd,
who sat near a window in the rear with
a newspaper in front of him.</p>

<p>“Did you hear all that, Nelson?” the
farmer asked.</p>

<p>“Did I? Of course I did; wasn’t it
intended for—?” The young merchant
glanced furtively at Peters and paused.
His handsome, dark face was set as
from some inward struggle.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Peters went toward
the front, a written account drying
in the air as he waved it to and fro.</p>

<p>“I was about to ask you if—?” the
young merchant started to say, but
he was interrupted by Baker.</p>

<p>“Hush, listen!”</p>

<p>There was the sound of clinking
coin on the counter below. The bell
on the cash-drawer rang as the clerk
put the money away.</p>

<p>“Thar, I’m even with this dirty
shebang!” It was Jeff Wade’s raised
voice. “An’ I kin act when the proper
time comes. Oh, you all know what
I’m talkin’ about! Nobody kin hide
a thing in these mountains. But
you’ll all understand it better ef it
ever comes into yore families. I never
had but one little sister—she was all
the Lord ever allowed me to have.
Well, she was married not more’n a
month ago, an’ went off to Texas
with a man who believes in ’er an’
swears he will make her a good husband
an’ protector. But no sooner
was the pore little thing gone than the
talk set in. It was writ out to her,
an’ she writ back to me to stop it.
She admitted it was true, but wouldn’t
lay the blame. Folks say they know,
but they won’t talk. They are afeared
o’ the influence o’ money an’ power,
I reckon, but it will git out. I have
my suspicions, but I’m not dead sure,
but I will be, an’ what I done fer that
scrap o’ paper I will do fer that man,
ef God don’t paralyze this right arm.
Ef the black-hearted devil is within
the sound o’ my voice at this minute,
an’ stays still, he’s not only the thief
of a woman’s happiness, but he’s wuss
than a coward. He’s a sneakin’
son——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>Nelson Floyd, his face rigid, sprang
up and went into Joe Peters’s little
bedroom, which was cut off in one
corner of the store. Opening the top
drawer of an old bureau, he took out
a revolver. Turning, he met the
stalwart form of Pole Baker in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Put down that gun, Nelson; put
it down!” Pole commanded. “Jeff
Wade’s deliberately set this trap to
draw you into it, an’ the minute you
walk down thar it will be a public
acknowledgment, an’ he’ll kill you ’fore
you can bat an eye.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Nelson Floyd;
“but the fellow has his rights. I
could never draw a free breath if this
passes. I owe it to the poor devil,
Pole, and I’ll pay. That has always
been my rule. I’ll pay. Stand aside!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be damned ef I do!” Pole stood
his ground firmly. “You must listen
to reason. It’s deliberate death.”</p>

<p>“Stand out of the way, Pole; don’t
make me mad,” said Floyd. “I’m
goin’ down. I’d expect him to pay
me, and I shall him.”</p>

<p>“Stop! you are a fool—you are
a hot-headed idiot, Nelson Floyd!
Listen to me”—Pole caught the revolver
and held on to the barrel of it,
while the young merchant clutched
the butt—“listen to me, I say.
Are you a-goin’ back on a helpless little
woman who gets married to a man
who believes in her an’ goes away off
an’ is on a fair road to happiness—are
you, I say, a-goin’ to publicly advertise
her shame, an’, no doubt, bust up
a contented home?”</p>

<p>“Great God, Pole!” exclaimed
Floyd as he sank on to the edge of
Peters’s bed, “do you think, if I give
him satisfaction, it will——?”</p>

<p>“Will it? It will be in every paper
from Maine to California. Meddlesome
devils will mark the articles an’ mail
’em to the gal’s husband. A lot o’
folks did the’r level best to bust up
the match anyway, by talkin’ to him
about you an’ others.”</p>

<p>Nelson Floyd stared at the floor
and slowly nodded his head.</p>

<p>“He’s caught me in a more degrading
trap than the other would
have been, Pole,” he declared bitterly.
“My conduct has branded me as a coward
and left me without power to
vindicate myself. That’s one of the
ways Providence has of punishing a
poor devil. He may have a good
impulse, but can’t act upon it owing
to the restrictions laid on him by his
very sins.”</p>

<p>Pole looked down into the store.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said gloomily.
“Wade’s gone.”</p>

<p>Floyd dropped the revolver into the
drawer of the bureau and went back
to his desk.</p>

<p>“It’s only a question of time, Pole,”
he said. “He suspects me now, but is
not sure. It won’t be long before the
full story will reach him, and then we’ll
have to meet. As far as I am concerned,
I’d rather have had it out
with him. I’ve swallowed a bitter
pill this mornin’, Pole.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t a lead one.”
Baker’s habitual sense of humor was
rising to the surface. “Most any sort
o’ physic is better’n cold metal shoved
into the system the wrong way.”</p>

<p>There was a step in the store. Pole
looked down again.</p>

<p>“It’s old Mayhew,” he said. “I’m
powerful glad he was late this mornin’,
Nelson. The old codger would have
seed through that talk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he would have seen through
it,” answered Floyd despondently as
he opened a big ledger and bent over
it.</p>

<p>Mayhew trudged toward them, his
heavy cane knocking against the long
dry-goods counter.</p>

<p>“I’ll have the law on that fellow!”
he growled as he hung his stick on its
accustomed nail behind the stove.
“No rampageous daredevil like that
can stand right in my door and shoot
for mere amusement at the county
court-house. This isn’t a fort yet, and
the war is over, thank the Lord.”</p>

<p>Pole glanced at Floyd.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s jest a little hilarious this
mornin’, Mr. Mayhew,” he said. “He
must ’a’ met a mountain whisky wagon
on his way to town. Anyways, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
needn’t complain; he come in here jest
now an’ paid off his account in
full.”</p>

<p>“What? Paid off? Is that so, Nelson?”</p>

<p>Floyd nodded, and then bent more
closely over the ledger. “Yes, he
paid up to date.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s queer—or I am, one
or the other. Why, boys, I had that
fellow on my dead-list. I didn’t think
he’d ever raise any money, and if he
did I had no idea it would drift our
way.”</p>

<p>Floyd left the desk and reached for
his hat. Pole was watching him
closely.</p>

<p>“Post-office?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.” The two walked part of the
way to the front door and paused.
Joe Peters was attending a man on the
grocery side of the house, and a young
woman neatly dressed, with a pretty
figure and graceful movement, stood
waiting her turn.</p>

<p>“By gum,” Pole exclaimed under
his breath, “that’s my little neighbor,
Cynthia Porter—the purtiest, neatest
an’ best little trick that ever wore a bonnet.
I needn’t tell you that, though,
you old scamp. You’ve already found
it out. Go wait on ’er, Nelson.
Don’t keep ’er standin’ thar.”</p>

<p>Pole sat on a bag of coffee and his
friend went to the girl.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Cynthia,” he
said, his hat in his hand. “Peters
seems busy. I don’t know much about
the stock, but if you’ll tell me what
you want I’ll look for it.”</p>

<p>Turning, she stared at him, her big
brown eyes under their long lashes
wide open as if in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why—why—” She seemed to be
making a valiant effort at self-control,
and then he noticed that her voice was
quivering and that she was quite
pale.</p>

<p>“I really didn’t want to buy anything,”
she said. “Mother sent me to
tell Mr. Peters that she couldn’t possibly
have the butter ready before tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the butter!” Floyd said, studying
her face and manner in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the girl went on, “she promised
to have ten pounds ready to send
to Darley, but the calves got to the cows
and spoiled everything. That threw
her at least a day behind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that don’t make a bit o’ difference
to us, Miss Cynthia,” the clerk
cried out from the scales, where he was
weighing a parcel of sugar. “Our
wagon ain’t going over till Saturday,
nohow.”</p>

<p>“Well, she will certainly be glad,”
the girl returned in a tone of relief, and
she moved toward the door. Floyd,
still wondering, went with her to the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>“You look pale,” he said tentatively,
“and—and, well, the truth is, I have
never seen you just this way, Cynthia.
Have you been having more trouble at
home? Is your mother still determined
that we sha’n’t have any more
of those delightful buggy-rides?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that—<i>today</i>,” she said,
her eyes raised to his in a glance that,
somehow, went straight to his heart.
“I’ll tell you. As I came on, I had
just reached Sim Tompkins’s field,
where he was planting corn and burning
stumps, when a negro—one of Captain
Duncan’s hands—passed on a mule. I
didn’t hear what he said, but when I
came to Sim he had stopped plowing
and was leaning over the fence saying,
‘Awful, horrible!’ and so on. I asked
him what had happened and he told
me—” she dropped her eyes, her words
hung in her throat and she put a slender,
tapering, though firm and sun-browned,
hand to her lips.</p>

<p>“Go on,” Floyd urged her,
“Tompkins said——”</p>

<p>“He said,” the girl swallowed, “that
you and Jeff Wade had had words in
front of the store and that Wade had
shot and killed you. I—I—didn’t
stop to inquire of anyone—I thought
it was true—and came on here.
When I saw you just then absolutely
unharmed I—I—of course—it surprised
me—or—I mean——”</p>

<p>“How ridiculous!” He laughed mechanically.
“There must be some mistake, Cynthia.
People always get things
crooked. That shows how little truth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
there is in reports. Wade came in
here and paid his bill, and did not even
speak to me or I to him.”</p>

<p>“But I heard pistol shots myself away
down the road,” said the girl, “and as
I came in I saw a group of men right
there. They were pointing down at the
sidewalk, and one of them said, ‘He
stood right there and fired three times.’”</p>

<p>Floyd laughed again, while her lynx
eyes slowly probed his face. He pointed
at the court-house door. “Cynthia,
do you see that envelope? Wade was
shooting at it. I haven’t been over
to see yet, but they say he put three
balls close together in its centre. We
ought to incorporate this place into
a town so that a thing of that sort
wouldn’t be allowed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was it!” Cynthia exclaimed
in a full breath of relief. “I
suppose you think I’m a goose to be
so scared at nothing.”</p>

<p>Floyd’s face clouded over, his eyes
went down. A customer was going into
the store, and he walked on to the street
corner with her before replying. Then
he said tenderly: “I’m glad, though,
Cynthia, that you felt badly, as I see
you did, when you thought I was done
for. Good-bye; I shall see you again
some way, I hope, before long, even if
your mother does object.”</p>

<p>As they walked away out of his sight
Pole Baker lowered his shaggy head
to his brawny hands, his elbows resting
on his knees.</p>

<p>“Fool!” he exclaimed. “Right now
with his head in the very jaws o’ death
he goes on talkin’ sweet stuff to women.
A purty face, a soft voice an’ a
pair o’ dreamy eyes would lead that
man right into the fire o’ hell itself.
But that hain’t the p’int. Pole
Baker, he’s yore friend, an’ Jeff Wade
is a-goin’ to kill ’im jest as shore as
preachin’.”</p>

<p>When Pole left the store he saw nothing
of Floyd, but he noticed something
else. He was passing Thigpen’s bar
and through the open doorway he
caught sight of a row of bottles behind
the counter. A seductive, soothing
odor greeted him; there was a merry
clicking of billiard balls in the rear,
the joyous thumping of cues on the
floor and merry laughter. Pole hesitated
and then plunged in. At any
rate, he told himself, one drink would
steady his nerves and show him some
way, perhaps, to rescue Floyd from
his overhanging peril. Pole took his
drink and sat down. Then a friend
came in and gave him two or three
more. Another of Pole’s sprees was
beginning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>How I Dined With President Grant</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY B. F. RILEY</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was in November, 1875. At
that time I was a student in
Crozer Theological Seminary,
near Philadelphia. The country was
just rallying from the effects of a long
and disastrous war, and as the centenary
of the nation would occur the
following year, preparations were being
made for the celebration of the event
by a great exposition, which was to be
held the next year in the City of Brotherly
Love. This was the first of our
great American expositions. It will
be remembered that this was called the
Centennial Exposition.</p>

<p>General Hawley, now a senator from
Connecticut, was made the superintendent
of this first great national undertaking
in the way of expositions. In
order to procure an adequate appropriation
from Congress, General Hawley
and the Centennial Commission conceived
the plan of bringing to Philadelphia
all the dignitaries and celebrities
from Washington. They were to
be shown the grounds and the unfinished
buildings, as well as the scope of
the mammoth undertaking. It was
further proposed that the people of
Philadelphia should give a banquet
to the distinguished visitors from
Washington. This banquet was given
in Horticultural Hall, the only building
that was sufficiently completed for
such a function. The sound of thousands
of hammers and the swish of
many saws resounded throughout the
Centennial grounds in Fairmount
Park.</p>

<p>A magnificent train was to bring the
distinguished guests from Washington,
and it was to arrive in Philadelphia at a
given hour of the evening. President
Grant and his Cabinet, both branches
of Congress and the judges of the
Supreme Court were to constitute the
excursion. They were of course the
guests of the city of Philadelphia, and
on their arrival were driven direct
to the hotels. As might naturally be
expected, such an event and occasion
set the city all agog, and the Philadelphia
press was filled with the manner
of their coming as well as the purpose.
Public excitement ran high, and the
excursion was the subject of universal
comment.</p>

<p>At that time I was an occasional correspondent
of two Alabama papers, one
a religious journal and the other a
secular one. Aware that this was the
most favorable opportunity I should
ever have for seeing so many of our
distinguished men, I resolved to go to
Philadelphia, and, if possible, come
into contact with them. No better
plan was suggested than to present
myself as a member of the press. I
imagined that there would not be the
slightest difficulty in accomplishing
this, and that all that was needed was
to represent myself as such, and the
opportunity sought of mingling with
the great would be at once afforded.
Decking myself in my best garb, which
was none the better for its long service,
I hied away to the city, fifteen miles
distant, on reaching which the suggestion
of a lean purse was followed in
going to a cheap boarding-house.</p>

<p>After a scanty supper I went to the
chief hotels where the great guests were
already arriving, bought an evening
paper for two cents, and found that a
committee of citizens had been appointed
to give information to all
strangers relative to the trip and the
banquet of the next day, which committee
was to be known by the red
rosettes which they wore. I threaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
my way as best I could through the
jammed corridors of the hotel, jostling
with army officers in brilliant uniforms,
and elegantly dressed statesmen,
until one of the committee wearing
a rosette was found.</p>

<p>Without apology, and perhaps in
rather an assertive way, I began in a
direct manner, telling him who I was,
what I was, and what I wanted as a
representative of the Southern press.
In reply to his question as to what
papers I represented, I frankly told
him, when he asked for my credentials.
But these were in the vocative, and so
I could produce none. He eyed me
very closely and with a distrustful
look while I sought to atone for the
absence of credentials by telling him
that, being in the city at the time of
learning fully of the event, I had not
the means of obtaining the desired credentials.
After hearing my statement
he told me that he feared nothing
could be done, and bluntly gave me to
understand that he could do nothing.
Once again I met him in the jam, but
he declined to notice me, of course.</p>

<p>Going across the street to the other
hotel, I mingled with the crowd, and
came upon two members of the committee
standing together. I presented
my request to them, and they said that
they were members of the Philadelphia
press and gave me a most cordial
reception. When they asked for my
authority to represent the Southern
papers, and I had none, they requested
my card, but I had not even a card.
They were evidently embarrassed, for
they showed a willingness to aid me,
but found themselves unable to do so.
After some courteous explanation they
expressed regret at being unable to
serve me, and one of them handed me
his card and asked me to apply at
Centennial headquarters, on Walnut
Street, the next morning, at eight
o’clock, and said that if anything could
be done, they were sure the Commission
would be glad to do it.</p>

<p>Some time before eight I was at the
Commission headquarters the next
morning, and when the doors were
opened I strode in, asking for the gentleman
whose name had been given me
the night before, and when I was presented
to him he looked at me with a
gaze of curiosity. I told my story as it
had been now several times repeated;
he listened with some impatience, and
asked for the credentials. He listened
to my explanation with a frown,
which indicated that he thought me a
fraud, and saying that he could do
nothing under the circumstances,
swung his chair around and gave me
no more heed, until I more than hinted
that perhaps I would be the only
correspondent present from the South,
and that I felt some consideration
was due me, especially if the Commission
cared to have the people of
the South attend on the forthcoming
exposition. The question of the
North and South was a sensitive one at
that time, and he replied that the
South could come if it desired, and
suggested that if I wished to remain
away he did not object. I replied
that the South was clearly being discriminated
against in the matter, as
representatives of the North were accorded
the consideration which I
sought. He demolished me with a
single blow when he said that they
came properly accredited.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed left now but to
hasten to the hotels and see what
could be done there. I accosted another
member of the committee of
citizens, but in no wise succeeded.
Already the carriages were drawn up
along the side of the street for several
blocks, awaiting the pleasure of the
visitors from Washington to go out to
Fairmount Park, where the buildings
were going up. Baffled at every point
here, I stepped into the street-car and
reached the park in advance of the procession.
Here I met a medical student
from the University of Pennsylvania
whom I had met before, and I told him
of my ups and downs, very much to
his amusement.</p>

<p>I had now practically given up the
hope of being thrown with the national
magnates, but when they began filing
through the great incomplete buildings,
and I stood with many others staring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
at them, without distinguishing one
from the other, there came an hour of
growing anxiety, stronger than before,
to know them, at least, by sight. I
still felt within myself that I might succeed
in getting into the banquet hall.
I mentioned it to my companion, who
sought to dissuade me from any further
effort, and said that it was folly
to attempt it. But when I saw the
horses’ heads turn toward the Horticultural
Hall, I bade the medical student
good-bye, and scudded across the
park through the cutting November
wind toward Horticultural Hall, fully
half a mile away. When I reached it,
I found it strongly guarded by three
cordons of policemen, standing about
twenty yards apart, and surrounding
the building. This did not inspire
much encouragement, and nothing
seemed so far away as the possibility
of getting into the hall. Meanwhile
the carriages were arriving, and the
distinguished guests were alighting,
and going rapidly into the hall. An
eager crowd of gazers stood near
where the carriages stopped and were
looking for dear life at everyone as he
stepped from the carriages. One Congressman
raised a loud laugh when he
leaped out and said:</p>

<p>“That other fellow is Grant!”</p>

<p>While I was thinking what I might
do next, several members of the committee
wearing rosettes were seen
coming toward the hall. With some
difficulty I reached them, and the
many-times-told tale was repeated
about my being a correspondent from
the South, to which they listened with
interest, and said:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go along in?”</p>

<p>“The policemen,” I said.</p>

<p>“Have you a badge?”</p>

<p>“No,” I innocently replied.</p>

<p>“We are out of them, or we would
give you one,” one of the group said.</p>

<p>“Come along with us, and we will
take you within the first line and send
someone out to show you in.”</p>

<p>Within the first line of policemen
they left me, promising to see to it that
I at once be shown in. Several minutes,
that seemed hours, passed, and
apprehensions began to arise that at
last I might slip in my arrangements.
My anxiety was quickened by a burly
Irish policeman approaching me with
his club, demanding to know what I
was doing there. I assumed a great
deal of courage and replied that one of
the committee had left me there on
business; and when he threatened to
put me out, I replied rather stoutly
that he might get himself into trouble
by tinkering with the official matters
of the commission. He used some ugly
language, and said that he knew his
business, and that he would let me
stay only a few minutes longer and
turned away on his beat. He again
approached me and hinted that I had
misled him by my statement, and that
I must “get out right away.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment a gentleman
wearing a rosette, and one whom I
had not before seen, appeared at the
entrance of the hall and was giving
some directions to policemen about the
door, when I hailed him rather unceremoniously
and laughingly told him that
I was in a fix and he must help me out,
that I was where the owl had the hen,
where I could neither back nor squall.
His face was a perfect interrogation
point as he approached me, and he
evidently thought fast while I told him
that this was a funny predicament for
a correspondent to be in. He listened
to me throughout and said:</p>

<p>“Why, yes, this will never do,” and,
laying his hand on my shoulder, led
me within the first door, and sent someone
for somebody else to escort me into
the banquet hall.</p>

<p>A gentleman soon appeared on the
scene and asked for that correspondent
who wanted to get in. I told him I was
the one, and he took my arm and led
me straight into the hall of banquet.
As I passed through suddenly I came
wellnigh coming into collision with
President Grant, who was standing
over a grate warming his feet. He
stared at me as though he was afraid
I might run over him, and I caught a
snatch of a conversation between himself
and another gentleman, who was
obviously twitting the President on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
size of his feet by relating an anecdote
of a Congressman on the streets of
Washington, who was trying to trade
with a bootblack for a polish, and the
shiner of shoes said that the job was
such a big one he would have to take
it by separate contracts. At this bit
of pleasantry Grant grimly smiled and
said nothing.</p>

<p>The improvised banquet hall was a
scene of splendor. The walls were festooned
with flags and bunting and pictures,
and the floors at the base of the
walls were adorned with flowers and
evergreens, while the long tables were
covered with gold and silver plate, cut-glass
and branching golden candelabra.
Running parallel with the wall on the
left, on a raised platform, was a long
table with sumptuous adornments
stretching at right angles to the tables
below. The seats of this elevated
table fronted those occupying the seats
on the floor. Immediately in the centre
of the table was the chair in which
John Hancock sat when he presided
over the convention which adopted the
Declaration of Independence. This antique
and high-backed piece of furniture
was overhung with silken banners
woven into appropriate designs and
a field of stars. This was the seat
provided for the President. Just in
front of him was an immense silver
laver filled with perfumes, while in the
centre was a beautifully dressed
roasted pig.</p>

<p>When the band began playing the
guests took their seats, and I sat on
the seat within easiest reach. When I
looked over the hall I saw that I was
the only one without a badge or decoration
of some sort. Luckily for me
I had a seat near a Congressman from
Arkansas, a gentleman who had been
a Confederate brigadier. He was
warm in his greetings to a young
Southerner and took great pains to
point out to me the most distinguished
of the guests. While we were admiring
the dainty souvenirs a negro waiter
borrowed one of mine, promising to
return it soon, and when he disappeared
the Congressman said:</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have allowed that
rascal to fool you; he is not going to
bring that back, but wants it for someone
else.”</p>

<p>He was correct, for I haven’t seen
the negro waiter since.</p>

<p>The banquet lasted more than an
hour, and the effects of the champagne
were soon manifest from the increased
boisterousness of the guests. So far as
I could observe, I was the only one
who declined the wine. When the cigars
were passed the guests dived their
hands deep into the boxes and took
hands full and filled their pockets. As
I did not smoke, I took mine to the
boys at the seminary who did.</p>

<p>The banquet being over, the toasts
began. After a neat speech by the
toastmaster, he announced the first
toast: “The President of the United
States.”</p>

<p>It was intended that this should be
responded to by Grant, but he sat as
unmoved as a statue. Cheer after
cheer rang out, and Grant was called
for in deafening chorus, but he was
imperturbable still. My Congressman
neighbor remarked in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Now, wouldn’t I feel ashamed to
be unable to say a word in response to
such a demonstration as this!”</p>

<p>As the President would not reply,
the other toasts were responded to by
Chief Justice Waite, the historian Bancroft,
James G. Blaine, Senator Oliver
P. Morton and one or two others of less
distinction.</p>

<p>The scene ended amid vociferous
songs, oaths and other expressions of
drunken disorder, which were not calculated
to inspire much respect in
the young theological student for the
law-makers and statesmen of the
country.</p>

<p>Making my way out of the hall, I
found that it was already dark on the
outside. I boarded a street-car and
was soon on board a train going toward
Crozer, and at nine o’clock was
in my room surrounded by a host of
the boys, to whom I related the experiences
of the day, while the smokers
in the crowd smoked my fine cigars.</p>

<p>And that is the way I dined with
President Grant.</p>

<a name="The_New_York_Childrens_Court" id="The_New_York_Childrens_Court">&nbsp;</a>
<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The New York Children’s Court</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY HON. JOSEPH M. DEUEL<br />
<i>Author of the legislation creating the Court and a Justice therein</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">A TRIBUNAL with an age-limit
for jurisdiction is a modern innovation.
For two years one
of that character has been passing
through an experimental stage in the
city of New York. It has fully justified
its creation. It is experimental
still, in the sense that two years have
been insufficient to exploit all its useful
possibilities. They are illimitable.
More than any in the world, the success
of this Court depends upon the personality
of the individual who wields its
powers; and, however capable, resourceful
and aspiring, he cannot be
eminently successful unless back of
him stands a strong, healthy and encouraging
public sentiment. This is
rapidly developing as parents come to
know that each justice is a willing and
enthusiastic ally, ready at all times to
join heartily with them to correct and
encourage the boy or girl who has been
tempted to go wrong, rather than an
ordinary minister of justice who measures
each infraction of law with statutory
precision.</p>

<p>When it is widely known that the
primary object is not one of punishment,
but of municipal and communal
salvage, its possibilities for good will be
greatly enhanced. No one has ever
sat with its presiding justice through
an entire session without some expression
of satisfaction with the Court
and the controlling policy in dealing
with wayward youth. Said a minister
of the Gospel recently, at the close of
a forenoon session: “You are doing
more good than all the ministers in the
city.” This exaggerated commendation
is cited simply to show that the
experimental stage cannot be on the
wrong tack when, after careful observation,
men of intelligence give utterance
to such convictions. But every member
of the community cannot see and
judge for himself, and this article is designed
to give to all a correct idea of
the Court, why created, and its policy
in dealing with offenders. Many
strangers, upon information not first-hand,
have been somewhat severe in
criticism of a supposed sentimental
leniency; they have become warm supporters
when brought into close range
with its operations.</p>

<p>No useful purpose will be served by
tracing the origin of the Court or singling
out and naming those who were
instrumental in its creation. It came
naturally by the process of evolution
in the matter of juvenile legislation.
Its advent was timely, for our civic
conditions, three years ago, were
breeding criminals more rapidly than
at any other time in our history; and a
court to deal solely with the source of
criminal supply was imperatively demanded.
One of the strongest arguments
at Albany for the bill was based
upon these conditions, and it was urged
that when fairly in progress the prophylactic
value of the Court would be
manifested in a reduced crime rate for
the city.</p>

<p>No one then anticipated the volume
and character of immigrants that have
since deluged our ports. Parents
with large families of growing children
have edged into overcrowded tenement
centres, where their native tongue
is almost exclusively spoken, and have
produced unwholesome social conditions,
that destroy the American
theory of home, by packing men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
women and children into one or two
small and ill-ventilated rooms. They
are without means of subsistence.
The market demand for their labor is
already supplied. No employment at
wages can be found, and, however
abundant in that respect may be the
prospects in other localities, here the
parents find themselves, and here they
insist on staying and taking chances.
Children swarm the streets, not only to
get sunlight and air, but to pick up
pennies, from whatever source available,
to pay rent and buy food. And
they are to become American citizens
under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The fault is not with parents, who
are lured here by golden hopes, held
before them by competing transportation
agents, but is with the governmental
policy that permits immigration
to go on without intelligent direction.
Possibly these people cannot be
induced to go to parts of the country
where there is a demand for the kind
of labor they can give, but their
crowding into New York is working
endless mischief in the men and women
produced.</p>

<p>The records show that boys and
girls who have lived here but a short
time, many less than a year, others
one, two and three years, get into
difficulties and find their way to the
Children’s Court, some for serious
crimes and others for contravening
state or local regulations of which
both parents and child are ignorant.
The child stays away from school to
peddle, or beg, or get money in other
ways, and, if he or she succeeds in
evading the police, is hunted by a
truant officer or runs foul of a “Gerry”
agent. Be the infractions serious or
trifling, they add materially to the
volume of child prisoners, swell the
inmates of reformatories, increase the
expense of city government and furnish
material for keeping up the army of
criminals.</p>

<p>Dr. David Blaustein estimates that
the square mile of territory bounded
by the Bowery, Mangin, East Houston
and Cherry Streets contains a Jewish
population of 350,000, largely composed
of Russian immigrants. If it
contained no other races there would
be a superficial area for light, ventilation,
business, recreation and living
less than three yards square for each
individual. Now for results. Mr.
Coulter, Deputy Clerk of the Children’s
Court, in a published article
recently stated that twenty-six per
cent. of child prisoners were of Russian
parents, ninety-eight per cent. of them
coming from the lower East Side and
the largest majority from the square
mile above mentioned.</p>

<p>The Italian contingent is estimated
at 400,000, which yields twenty-four
per cent. of the juvenile arrests. Russian
and Italian immigrants have a predilection
for hiving like bees rather than
for living like Americans. They have
no inclination to go to those parts of
the city where room, light and ventilation
are in abundance, but select a
locality where others speaking the
same tongue have settled. Then begins
the crowding process which drives
other races from the neighborhood.
Children run wild in the streets, form
undesirable associations and become
easy victims to rapacious Fagins
everywhere abounding. The parents
do not learn our language with any
degree of efficiency, and acquire slight
knowledge of our government, its
policies or ideals. Instances occur
daily of witnesses that have lived here
fifteen to twenty years who require an
official interpreter to give testimony.</p>

<p>Russian and Italian nationalities
furnish more than half of the business
of the Children’s Court. It is not
wholly racial, because ordinarily the
Jew is devoted to his family, is law
abiding and is not prone to active
crime. Upon this point Mr. Coulter
calls attention to the fact that with
an estimated population of 75,000
Jews in the Bronx that borough furnishes
but few juvenile criminals of
this race. He might have added that
such as came were of a mischievous or
trivial character except when boys
from the congested centres made
predatory excursions to that neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>The statistics gathered at the Court
do not furnish data from which to
compute the length of time delinquents
have been in the city. This is
generally brought out in the course of
trial or investigation. I have before me
the trial record of several cases of
recent occurrence. In December last
Mrs. Rosie Rosenthal, of No. 329
Stanton street, brought Isidore Weinstein
into Court and asked that he be
committed as incorrigible and ungovernable.
In the course of the proceedings
it was developed that the boy was
so bad at home in Hungary that his
parents sent him here to get rid of him.
He came in September, 1904, with a
man living in Nashville, Tenn., stopped
one night with the aunt and then went
South. Six weeks later the man
shipped the boy back to the aunt
because he was hopeless. Instead of
committing him to an institution at
an expense of two dollars a week to
the taxpayers, the whole power and
influence of the Court were bent on
having him returned to Europe.</p>

<p>Another case was Robert Pries, who
pleaded guilty, January 13, to stealing
jewelry valued at one hundred and
fifty dollars from a guest in a city hotel
where the boy was employed. He
came from Germany alone last August
and had no relatives in this country.
He had been a bell-boy at the hotel
three days and used a pass key to commit
the offense.</p>

<p>Raffael Basignano, illegitimate, came
from Italy last July with a friend. He
was brought up in San Malino by a
woman, not his mother, known as
Philomena. She came here, settled
at Flushing and then sent money to
pay his passage. She died before his
arrival; he drifted to New York, and
then reached the Children’s Court.
Efforts to deport these last two are in
progress.</p>

<p>These are types of many coming
to this Court for disposition.
Taken in connection with the localities
whence comes the largest amount of
business, it may be concluded that two
factors are producing prisoners to an
extent dangerously menacing the future
good order of this city: Immigration
laws and congested tenement
centres. If there be any fault with
the former or in their administration
the remedy lies with Congress; as to defects
in the latter we must look both to
Albany and the local government for
relief. The Children’s Court is battling
against odds not anticipated
when created, and with creditable success.
Scarcely a session passes without
definite results, and a parole day
never goes by without some demonstration
of the Court’s usefulness.</p>

<p>When the bill to create the Court
was pending, its theoretical value had
to be appraised by contrast with the
system to be displaced. Its practical
value is better understood by the same
method. In fact, no true conception
of its potency and usefulness otherwise
can be realized. Formerly all children
charged with crime, delinquency,
want of proper guardianship or found
in a state of destitution were taken to
the various police courts. In the matter
of guardianship, destitution and
some of the minor offenses the magistrates
had power to hear and determine.
In cases of felony and misdemeanor
the police court was simply a
sieve to separate those crimes and to
send the former to General Sessions and
the latter to Special Sessions for trial.
In General Sessions the cases had to
be submitted to a grand jury and, if
indicted, a trial followed before a
petty jury.</p>

<p>There were discouraging delays.
Few were indicted and scarcely any
convicted. Those youthful offenders
on returning home unscathed became
heroes in the estimation of companions;
in their own minds they were
immune to punishment because of
superior skill and deftness. They did
not understand that escape was due to
sympathy. Each became a missionary
in crime to corrupt others; became a
chief of admiring associates and spent
his time and energy in devising methods
of pillage and robbery. In consequence
organized bands of youthful
desperadoes sprang up in various parts
of the city which were known as “de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
gang.” A vicious boy with goodly
sums of money in his pockets to flash
before and spend upon impecunious
associates can do more moral damage
in a week than Sunday schools can correct
in a year.</p>

<p>Ten years ago pickpockets in the
teens were a rarity; a few years later
frequent arrests made the subject somewhat
conspicuous; in 1900 the arraignment
of several in one day in the Essex
Market Court was quite usual. Several
youngsters acted in concert, each
performed some important part in the
process, and all shared in the spoils: a
small percentage satisfied the younger
lads who had slight experience in
handling money. Ready money for
theatres and cigarettes, besides something
to quiet parental inquisitiveness,
is an alluring bait to a child with slight
moral supervision and guidance—far
more fascinating than hard work or
school drudgery and with promises of
more freedom and luxury. And it is
such a simple matter to deceive unsuspecting
parents who are unable to
speak our language. Besides, the
young culprit knows how to weave
fairy tales about some alleged employer
that head off all investigations.</p>

<p>It is charitable to assume that confiding
parents in their simple trustfulness
have no conception of the temptations
to which their children are subjected,
but the facts far too frequently
indicate supreme indifference. I have
known fathers of girls just verging into
womanhood to appear in Court and
testify that a disorderly house next
door, or in the same building one
flight down, was not a nuisance. A
father of this character whose child,
boy or girl brings home money never
cares to know its source. If the money
comes no questions are asked, or, if
asked, the answers are never verified.</p>

<p>This kind of parent is typical of
many now coming here, and it is he or
she whose progeny furnishes business
for the Children’s Court and recruits
for the criminal ranks. The youngster
having started in with some weekly
amount to carry home had to maintain
it. If it was not available when
Saturday came desperate chances were
taken which often resulted in detection
and arrest. But conviction and
punishment were rare. Fagins multiplied
and recruits were plentiful.
Picking pockets with so many pickers
at work was a little overdone and
larceny in all its forms was studied and
operated. We soon had the youthful
burglar, highway robber, forger, till-tapper,
wagon thief and pilfering
employee.</p>

<p>The old system was making no
headway against crime, for the simple
reason that it did not effectively
operate against the source and lacked
the requisite machinery for dealing
therewith. Sympathetic leniency was
too prevalent; the time and thought of
judges were taken up with adult cases;
little attention could be given to
restraint and supervision. Even if
these judges had the time and the
inclination they were powerless because
grand jurors failed to indict and
petty jurors could not be persuaded to
convict.</p>

<p>Only recently a grand juror, speaking
of his work, criticized a magistrate
for sending a boy of seventeen
to trial for larceny because the amount
stolen was but a few dollars; it did not
dawn upon him that the boy was not
at fault for stealing so little; he probably
took all he could. It is the thieving
propensity in the young, not the
amount stolen, that most vitally concerns
the community. The amount, by
statute and by Court custom, is one
factor in admeasuring sentence in adult
cases; with juveniles it is inconsequential,
and in no way decisive of
treatment after conviction. This is
the spirit of the law also that permits
felonious acts to be tried as misdemeanors
if committed by children
under sixteen.</p>

<p>Treatment wisely can be determined
only with some insight of the boy’s
disposition, knowledge of his tendencies
and information of home environment.
In other words, thieving
to some extent is a preventable evil,
and the treatment several boys should
have may vary as much as a physician’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
prescriptions among an equal
number afflicted with a like physical
ailment. The old judicial plan, as it
had continued for years, sent the
youngster home without a reprimand
or a warning, kept it up until all too
late a hardened and confirmed criminal
was the result, and upon him were
visited punitive and vindictive powers.
Criminal propensities are akin to
physical appetites in that they become
habits by indulgence. It is easier
to keep a boy from smoking cigarettes
than to break him of the habit after
long practice. On the same principle
a youthful offender may be checked
much easier than a hardened criminal
can be redeemed.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions when the
Children’s Court was created, and
such were the principles upon which
it was founded. It has been in existence
and operation since September 2,
1902. Its policies, plans and methods,
while not perfect, stand in refreshing
and encouraging contrast to those that
preceded, and it is exerting power and
influence that may be measured with
some degree of accuracy and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Instead of delay ending in failures,
we have promptness bringing results.
Children are not lugged from court to
court, often going to each several times
before a hearing; they come up for
trial not later than the day following
arrest, and they do not have to return
unless convicted; even then many are
permitted to go home with some sense
of what they have done, the reasons
making it objectionable and the consequences
sure to follow a repetition.
The quickness with which conviction
follows the commission of an offense
is of the highest importance; especially
if it be a serious crime, such as larceny,
burglary, etc. It is one of the Court’s
most valuable assets.</p>

<p>There is a total suppression of sympathy
or sentiment during trial. The
prisoner is arraigned, the charge is explained
and then he or she must plead
guilty or not guilty. Each has the
benefit of counsel—if not employed by
a parent the Court invariably assigns
one; the trial proceeds at once if
the plea is “not guilty,” and at its
close comes acquittal or conviction.
During all this time a dispassionate
and methodical inquiry is pursued by
strict legal methods, in which the prisoner
has the advantage of every technicality
known to criminal practice.
The justice presiding is both judge and
jury. He has absolute control over
future proceedings; if there be a conviction,
therefore, he divests himself
entirely of pity or prejudice. With
him it is simply the elucidation of facts
by strict legal evidence and reaching
a conclusion that is logical and just.
There are objections and rulings, demurrers
to pleadings, motions for new
trials and motions in arrest of judgment.
Frequently some bright boy
defendant watches the progress of the
trial with interest and learns something
which, never injurious, may be
of advantage. The sad and possibly
harmful thing is that he is on trial for
a crime; and yet that one feature may
save him from a disastrous career.</p>

<p>The time for pity, sympathy and
sentiment on the part of the justice
comes when he pronounces the defendant
guilty. Then the character and
attitude of the man upon the bench
undergo a complete change, for a duty
far transcending that of weighing facts
and reaching conclusions now devolves
upon him. This duty is to determine
what to do with the youngster who
has been convicted, and upon this
question the greatest mistakes may be
made; it is the one that weighs most
heavily on the conscience of the Court
and is the most perplexing to the judicial
mind.</p>

<p>The controlling principle in the solution
is, what is best for the boy is best
for society; he must either be committed
to some reformatory presided
over by persons of like religious faith
as the parents, or he must be permitted
to return home. Either course may be
dangerous. To commit may blast his
future; to release may be iniquitous to
him and a positive menace to others.
In order to decide the judge must
learn all that is possible about the individual;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
his habits, disposition, associations,
reputation, home environment
and previous record. If the boy
attends school his record there is obtained;
if at work the opinion of the
employer is sought, but in a way not
to produce injury. Happily the law
upon this subject permits the Court to
get information through any channel,
not even gossip, rumor or hearsay is
excluded. In many cases several days
are necessary to gather the material
upon which the Court finally acts.</p>

<p>The majority of the cases do not
require postponement for this purpose.
The records of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children are so
complete and instantly available as to
enable us to know at the close of the trial
whether there has been a previous conviction,
which is of the first importance.
If there be none, a suspended sentence
or a parole generally follows, for it is
believed that with the majority better
results are obtainable through fear under
freedom than by discipline under
restraint.</p>

<p>There is a misunderstanding in the
public mind, and unfortunately with
some of the police officers, as to “suspended
sentence.” It means that
criminal punishment is not then inflicted,
but may be the following week
or month or some time thereafter, but
will not be so long as the youngster is
of good behavior. The boys understand
that they will not be molested so
long as no bad report reaches the Court,
and the most of them act accordingly.
Quite recently several on parole for
engaging in street stone fights were
separately asked what they did during
the epidemic of stone battles that broke
out in January. They replied that
they ran home and stayed there while
the fight lasted. A suspended sentence
is quite apt to work in the same
way with most boys, for a second conviction
would surely disclose the former,
and punishment then is severe.</p>

<p>Occasionally a boy is sent to an institution
on his first conviction as a
safeguard against parents whose depravity
and shameless indifference are
positively detrimental, and sometimes
a child is permitted to go home and
remain so long as the mother avoids
drink. Good work has been done in
both directions—the boy removed
from iniquitous surroundings, or these
mended through parental affection.</p>

<p>A child is rarely committed for the
first offense, no matter how serious it
may be; there is a remand to the Society
for its officers to gather and report information
of the individual and environment,
and then sentence is deferred
and the child put on parole. He
goes home with an opportunity to earn
a suspended sentence by his individual
conduct, which covers a wide range. It
is intended to correct every bad trait;
evil associations are to be avoided;
staying away from home nights must
cease; conduct everywhere—in the
house, on the streets and at school—must
be exemplary. During this time
he is under the supervision of the
parole officer, to whom there must be a
report each week and at the end of the
period—four, five or six weeks—appearance
and report in Court. If a
high standard of excellence is reached,
sentence is suspended; if there is improvement,
parole is continued; if the
boy continues in his old ways, sentence
is imposed, or there may be a short
parole with certain commitment at the
end if a radical change is not shown.</p>

<p>By these means the boy sees that
others are interested in his welfare,
and he gets encouragement in all directions,
for neighbors, noting the change,
treat him accordingly. Frequently he
gets sufficient satisfaction out of the experience
to determine that he will continue
in the same way, and in all cases
he learns what he can do by exercising
self-control; it never works harm and
often produces most gratifying results.
I mention a few as indicative of many
within the experience of every justice
holding the Court.</p>

<p>In October last a widow had her only
child, a boy of fourteen, taken into custody
by the police for absolute incorrigibility;
he stayed out nights, associated
with bad companions, would not
work and was rude and insolent. On
the following morning the mother appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
in Court to press the charge
under oath and insisted that the boy
be committed forthwith. The usual
practice was followed; the boy was remanded
to the Society and an investigation
ordered; the report confirmed
everything the mother had alleged,
and the few days of separation had in
no way changed her determination to
have the boy committed, for, as she
declared, she was completely discouraged,
and he was past redemption.
Something about the boy led me in the
opposite direction and I said to her,
“I think we had better give this young
man just one more chance,” and, turning
to him, I said, “Don’t you think so,
my boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Judge,” was the quick response.</p>

<p>After some conversation with the
mother, who finally relented, a five
weeks’ parole was ordered. On the
return day both were in Court. The
boy, tidy in appearance, stood erect and
looked me manfully in the eye as he
took his place before the bench. The
parole officer’s report, in writing, told
me that immediately following parole
the boy had secured a position in a
hardware store, and by industry, attention
and intelligence had obtained a
voluntary promise of increased wages;
that he had spent his evenings, during
parole, at home, which the mother confirmed
and with moistened eyes she
added:</p>

<p>“I could not ask for a better boy, and
we are both happy.” The boy had
found what he could do by trying, and
was satisfied. It would be difficult to
determine which was the prouder and
happier, the mother or son, as they left
Court together.</p>

<p>A disorderly boy at school, and an
habitual truant, coming up for commitment
asked me to try him on
parole. He came back a month later
with a school certificate of 100 per
cent. in attendance and deportment.
A father brought his boy of fourteen
to Court for commitment because of
prolonged disobedience, which could
not be corrected by chastening; he was
a nuisance in the neighborhood and
the complaints sent to the house had
utterly destroyed paternal confidence.
He was put on parole against the
father’s protest. A month later the
father reported a satisfactory change,
which, as the parole officer’s report
stated, had been noticed by the neighbors.
On request the parole was continued
for a month, when the report
of father and parole officer showed
almost perfect conduct. On the
father’s special request the parole
period was extended two months.
While these are exceptional cases they
are by no means rare.</p>

<p>From this extreme there is a gradual
shading downward to the point of
absolute hopelessness, when the subject
is turned over to the disciplinary
methods of a reformatory. During
the year 1904 out of 1,098 paroles 170,
or 15½ per cent., were subsequently
committed, which shows satisfactory
results of 84½ per cent. Nineteen
hundred and three was a trifle better
with its 1,117 paroles, of which 13⅕
per cent. refused to be benefited. But
if one-half of the lads can be redeemed
or kept within reasonable bounds
during character formative period, the
Court will prove a success, and intelligent
citizens will regard the parole
system as worthy of continuance and
extension. It is harmful to none and
gives each a fair chance to test self-reliance
and manhood; it does not
injure the boy past redemption, but
simply postpones commitment, and
is a wholesome demonstration to him
that his misfortune is of his own choosing.</p>

<p>The boys generally understand that
but one chance can be expected, and
coming back a second time on a
serious charge the benefit of parole will
be withheld. This is not an inflexible
rule. If there are good prospects a
second or even a third parole would
not be refused. But there must be
more than mere possibility to secure
a second and exceedingly strong assurances
for a third parole. One good
test of its beneficence is the frequency
with which parents ask that
it be extended rather than terminated;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
always on the same ground that the
boy is better behaved at home and at
school, and is more careful of his associations.</p>

<p>There is another factor that gives
the boys considerable worry and serves
somewhat as a deterrent: the “Gerry
Society,” with its complete up-to-date
record running back for thirty years.
When the time comes for pronouncing
judgment a Society representative—one
or more always being in Court—is
called upon for the record of the boy
and his family. This is given in his
presence, and sometimes involves older
brothers or sisters. So that the
youngster goes out of Court convinced
that it is impossible to hide any misdeed.
The services of the Society and
its officers are of inestimable value in
the conduct of this Court.</p>

<p>A feature of the Court which would
occur only to one who is a frequent
visitor and careful observer of its
proceedings is that of a practical
kindergarten in civics to those most
in need of instruction. As to offenses
involving moral turpitude—larceny,
burglary, picking pockets, etc.—the
child and the parents know the act
is wrong and why it calls for arrest and
punishment. But this is not true of
a great many arrests; possibly one-third
of those made during any year.
There are many acts forbidden in
a crowded city that would be unobjectionable
elsewhere. An arrest is
sure to bring to the Court a surprised
and indignant parent. Such acts come
under the classification <i>mala prohibita</i>
and include bonfires, ball playing,
craps, cat, throwing missiles, jumping
on and off street cars, truancy, peddling,
etc. It is for the justice to
explain why the act is condemned and
forbidden.</p>

<p>Bonfires may be taken as an illustration.
Many arrests were made on
the day of the last election, and each
boy confessed that the fires were political.
The boys assiduously gather
fuel for days in advance and will burn
it election night, whoever is elected.
The lads were commended for political
zeal, and were asked whether they
wanted to become good or bad politicians.
The answer, of course, was
“good,” and then they were informed
that they had started out wrong, because
a good politician always studied
how to save the people from needless
expense; that fires on asphalt pavement
ruin an area that may require twenty-five,
fifty or a hundred dollars to repair,
which has to be raised by taxation,
and some portion of it each individual
boy or man must pay either directly
as a property owner or indirectly
in the increased cost of rent, clothing,
fuel, groceries and other purchases.
Other matters are explained on similar
lines, and often the eyes of some
youngster will brighten as the explanation
proceeds and at its close he will
say, “I didn’t know it was so bad; I’ll
never do it again.” Such a boy rarely
comes back on a second charge. These
explanations are not made purely for
instruction, but to inform the child
that behind all law interdicting ordinary
acts there are good reasons and
to state them so as to come within
youthful comprehension.</p>

<p>The child is not the only beneficiary,
for the English-speaking parent absorbs
some of the information, and
each goes away knowing why it is unlawful
to build bonfires, play crap or
ball, or do other things which result in
arrest. When time permits, the non-English-speaking
parent gets his information
on these topics through the
official interpreter. To punish a child,
or through him the parent, for an
act when neither understands why
it is forbidden, is extremely distasteful;
but such instances occur, and punishment
is inflicted because it is the
only method for impressing clearly on
their minds that the act must not be
repeated.</p>

<p>Thus far boys only have been mentioned;
but a like method of treatment
applies to girls whenever there is occasion,
which is not often. Fortunately
for the world in general and this city in
particular, the female sex is far less
prone to crime and venality. This is
specially prominent in the Children’s
Court, for, eliminating improper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
guardianship—neither boy nor girl being responsible
therefor—girl prisoners constituted
but four per cent. of the cases.
In the police courts women make up
twenty per cent. of arrests. There were
but thirty-eight girl defendants in a
total of 1,055 larcenies, six in a total
of 2,870 disorderly conduct cases, two
in the 50 robberies, two in 197 assaults,
two in the 346 burglaries; of the three
attempts at suicide all were girls. It
may truthfully be said that womankind
is the crowning glory of the race
and the sheet-anchor of progressive
civilization.</p>

<p>Much time is consumed with questions
of improper guardianship, of
which during the year there were 1,983
cases; during 1903, 1,582. These complaints
are rapidly increasing, partially
because of ignorant and indifferent
aliens. But the machinery for dealing
with such matters is so much better
than formerly existed that more attention
is given to the subject. During
the year preceding the establishment
of this Court there were but 539 such
cases in the seven City Magistrates’
courts of this division. There is greater
firmness in dealing with them than
with some transgression of the child.
While the subject of inquiry is under
sixteen years of age the cases practically
are of parental adjudication; the
fathers and mothers are on trial, and
it is one or the other that is disciplined
if the complaint is well founded. If
the evil be drink, which is true as to
many of the cases, it sometimes may
be overcome if parental affection and
desire to retain custody of the child
are well developed; if in surroundings
coming within parental means to correct
or in restraint and supervision
which parents neglect to exercise, the
objection is overcome with most parents
by a warning. While testing sincerity
and ability the child is permitted
to remain at home. In this
way children are given approximately
fair opportunity to develop proper and
becoming tendencies. The world
would be tremendously shocked if it
could know how many of its criminals,
paupers and vagrants are caused primarily
by home environment and improper
parental conduct.</p>

Orleans in January decided that the
Wall Street “bear” was worse than
the Texas weevil.</p>

<p>Yellow-dog politics is the spirit that
moves a man to ride to hell in a two-wheel
cart drawn by the Democratic
mule or Republican elephant, rather
than to go to heaven by the independent
route.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to know that a real
effort is being made to “control”
the railroads. The failure of such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
effort is the best evidence that it
can’t be done. Then will come public
ownership.</p>

<p>The government has no more right
to farm out to the bankers the privilege
of issuing money than it has to
grant to a few rich farmers the exclusive
privilege of breeding short-horn
cattle.</p>

<p>It is said that gold furnishes a
stable currency, but history teaches
that it is the most cowardly money
ever used. In time of war, when it is
needed most, it hides itself and paper
money fights the battles.</p>

<p>The glory of war is a relic of barbarism.
It differs only in form from
the ghoulish dances of the aborigines,
or the fiend-like performances of the
Dervishes. “War is hell.” Its spirit
is of the devil. Nine-tenths of the
wars could be avoided. They are
caused by the selfishness of man.</p>

<p>In this day of progress and invention
no man can define radicalism. That
which appears radical today is conservative
tomorrow. The leaven of
a higher and better civilization is
working in the hearts of the people,
and the day of emancipation from
false systems draws near.</p>

<p>In the past ten years in this country
the railroads have killed and crippled
more people than all the wars in
which this government was ever engaged.
Put that in your pipe and
smoke it, and then howl against government
ownership.</p>

<p>It is urged that the greenbacks
should be retired, because they constitute
an “endless chain” to deplete
the gold reserve in the Treasury. It
should be remembered that no one
ever uses the “endless chain” but the
bankers. The people don’t want the
gold; they would rather have the
greenbacks, and they will take them
without any gold behind them. The
way to break the “endless chain” is
to abolish the gold reserve.</p>

<p>Bryan seems bent on building up a
straw party for the Republicans to
knock down. In doing so he is playing
into the hands of the Republicans,
and he is using some good men for
straw. He is doing just what the
Republican bosses want him to do.
Whether he has sense enough to see it,
does not alter the situation. Every
move he makes tends to divide the
Democratic Party and help the Republicans.</p>

<p>The bold and brazen bag-barons of
the Beef Trust will in all probability
find some way to dodge the injunction
issued against them. There is an old
saying that runs something like “catch
your cottontail before you cook it,”
or words to that effect. If there is no
change in prices of cattle and beef,
you may rest assured that the beef
barons are still robbing the people at
both ends of the line.</p>

<p>For thirty years I have heard this
talk of the better class of men in the
Democratic Party getting control of
it and bringing it back to its old-time
moorings, but the party is in a much
worse condition today than it ever
has been before. That there are good
men in it, no one will attempt to deny.
The rank and file of the party are
honest and sincere, but the party is
controlled by the most unscrupulous
set of buccaneers that ever existed,
and, under the system of primaries
and conventions, the people have no
more show to win against the professional
politicians than a goose
would have in a running match with a
red fox. The party is not only divided
and demoralized, but it is disgraced
in the eyes of the people. The
attempt of the party in the recent
campaign to ape the methods of the
Republican Party as practiced by Mr.
Hanna in 1896 and 1900, and its bid
for Wall Street support, were despicable
beyond description. A party
that has for years laid claim to being
a reform party, that will stoop to
such contemptible methods, deserves
not only the distrust of the people, but
their everlasting condemnation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Heritage of Maxwell Fair</i></h2></div>

<p class="center space-above1 space-below1">BY VINCENT HARPER</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</h3>

<p class="blockquot space-below2">Maxwell Fair, an Englishman who has amassed a
colossal fortune on ’Change, inherits from his ancestors
a remarkable tendency to devote his life to some
object, generally a worthy, if peculiar one, which is
extravagantly chivalrous, even morbid. The story
opens with Fair and Mrs. Fair standing over the body
of a man who has just been shot in their house—a
foreigner, who had claimed to be an old friend of Mrs.
Fair. Fair sends her to her room, saying: “Leave
everything to me.” He hides the body in a chest, and
decides to close the house “for a trip on the Continent.”
Fair tells the governess, Kate Mettleby, that he loves
her, that there is no dishonor in his love, in spite of
Mrs. Fair’s existence, and that, until an hour ago, he
thought he could marry her—could “break the self-imposed
conditions of his weird life-purpose.” They
are interrupted before Kate, who really loves him, is
made to understand. While the Fairs are entertaining
a few old friends at dinner, Kate, not knowing that it
contains Mrs. Fair’s blood-stained dress, is about to
hide a parcel in the chest when she is startled by a
sound.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">“HSS—hss,” once more came
the noise, and this time she
realized that it proceeded
from the doorway. With a frightened
look she saw a man peering and smiling
at her between the portières.</p>

<p>“Why, who are you?” she asked,
involuntarily retreating toward the
bell.</p>

<p>“Sh-h. They are at dinner—a very
good dinner, from the smell, too,”
answered the stranger, entering the
room with an air of such thorough
good-nature and easy friendliness that
Miss Mettleby gained courage. He
was a little, wiry, dapper, insinuating
fellow whose cockney smartness of
attire and knowing, “between ourselves”
manner suggested almost anything,
from an upper groom or a
veterinary’s assistant to a rising young
follower of the turf or a successful
burglar with aristocratic connections.</p>

<p>“I will ring,” said Miss Mettleby,
puzzled whether to scream or laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, you know,”
suggested the visitor pleasantly, more
like one throwing out a friendly suggestion
than a burglar intimidating
a very frightened young governess.
“You see, miss, I have business with
Mr. Fair—rather nasty business, too,
and I never broach a disagreeable
subject until after dinner, do you?”</p>

<p>“But what do you mean by prowling
about people’s houses?” asked
Kate, with a dignity born of growing
assurance that the man did not contemplate
her immediate murder.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, let up, miss, you know,”
deprecated the invader ruefully. “You
see, when you have passed a few hours
back of pianos and under beds and
in wardrobes you grow attached to a
house, don’t you, miss? I’m that
attached to this house that you’d be
surprised if I was to tell you how
much. You’ll be the governess now,
I dare say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but on my word, you are the
coolest thief—” replied Kate, and the
cool one broke in:</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, pretty young lady, recall
that there wile insinuation, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you are so cool about
it and come here where you are sure
to be seen, I’ll believe you,” answered
Miss Mettleby. “But what do you
want? Really, this is refreshing.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it just, miss?” acquiesced
the cool one, sitting down. “Askin’
your pardon, I’ll smoke. Now, miss,
that we’re so cozy like, I’ll ask you a
few questions. A dark foreign gentlemen
called here about an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did—what of it?”
asked Kate, with a very feeble effort
to cover the alarm which his words
created.</p>

<p>“You saw him?” went on the
stranger, with an exasperating coolness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“If I did, I don’t see what business
that is of yours,” retorted Kate
haughtily enough, but inwardly quaking.
“Who are you, sir?”</p>

<p>“I am Ferret, miss,” he answered,
rising and bowing; “Mr. Samuel
Ferret, of the Scotland Yard private
detective force—your servant.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious,” cried Miss Mettleby,
springing up in spite of her effort
to betray no feeling. “A detective?
But why should you come here?”</p>

<p>Poor Kate’s alarm would have been
considerably heightened had she only
known that three or four other insinuating
and evanescent gentlemen
had been in and out of the premises for
the past hour, and that still more of
them were at that moment watching
the house, front and rear.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, miss,” replied Ferret,
trying by his manner to reassure the
young woman, “I’ve been taking an interest
in my foreign friend for a week.
He came here today. I haven’t seen
him go away again? Have you?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Kate, with an indifference
which she did not feel; “but
he must have gone, of course. There
is no such person about the premises.
I must ring and advise Mr. Fair.”</p>

<p>“Now, really, you know,” exclaimed
Ferret, jumping up to intercept her;
“I wouldn’t do that, would you?
When a gent goes into a house and
don’t come out again, it is just possible
to imagine that he is somewhere
near that house, not to say in that
house. You follow me, I hope? Well,
my dear foreign friend came into this
here very elegant mansion and he
didn’t go out of it again, so by a
stretch of fancy I think he may be
in London yet, and in that part of
London which is up in your attic.
Now, don’t jump. If you make a
row, you’ll frighten the great folks
at dinner—such a deucedly good
dinner, too—and besides give my
foreign friend advance knowledge of
my little surprise party—I just love
surprises, don’t you? And them there
foreign gents can get out through a
smaller hole than a self-respecting
Englishman, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“But who is the man?” asked Kate,
forgetting her alarm as Ferret, with
the oddest winks and gestures with
his long thumbs, delivered his speech.
“And what is he doing here? And
what do you propose to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Me? What do I propose to do
about it?” inquired Ferret as if the
thought that he would be expected
to do something about it had just
struck him. “Well, first of all, I
propose to ask you to be a nice young
lady and help me a bit. You see,
miss, my friend don’t mean any great
kindness to Mr. and Mrs. Fair. Not
a bit of it—that ain’t like my friend.
In fact, there’s going to be a row—now,
now, don’t jump, you know—I
was saying that there is going to be
a row, unless you and I prevent it,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Then I insist upon telling Mr.
Fair at once—this is awful,” cried
Kate, beginning again to believe that
the alleged detective was simply a
clever sneak-thief who was playing
upon her ignorance.</p>

<p>“Hawful is it?” smiled Ferret,
warning her to remain seated with a
hand lifted eloquently; “but it won’t
be hawful, but just a pleasant little
picnic if you will do just what I tell
you. Come now, don’t be a fool, miss,
but a dear, good, cool-headed young
lady. Will you help me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Miss Mettleby; “of
course I will do anything to help Mr.
Fair—I mean, Mrs. Fair.”</p>

<p>“Of course you will,” said Ferret
encouragingly. “I knew you was a
Christian the minute I see you, miss.
You stop in this room until I come
back. I am going out to telephone,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have a telephone in the
house, you know,” eagerly remarked
Kate, not liking the idea of being kept
a prisoner in the library while this
man roamed about the house at his
leisure.</p>

<p>“Yes,” jeered Ferret; “and it would
be a fine thing, wouldn’t it, for me to
yell through your telephone downstairs
that I wanted the Yard to
send me six constables at once to nab<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
a foreign gentleman—with the foreign
gent himself lying under the very mat
on which I was standing. Innocent!
No. I must go out to telephone—and
if you sort of want to see me safe
out of the house, why, come down
to the door with me—yes, that’s it.
I want you to sit in the little room
by the street door, and when my
friend goes out the door follow him—follow
him, miss, you understand.
He will go across the street, down the
next street to the square, turn to the
left, and call a cab at the corner.
You call the next cab and direct the
driver to follow the first one. Watch
him, follow him, don’t lose sight of
him.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t be such a fool
as to go out by the front door,” replied
Kate, thoroughly puzzled by
Ferret’s mysterious instructions, which
she, of course, did not understand
were merely attempts on his part to
get her out of his way and fixed permanently
in some known room.</p>

<p>“Never fear,” answered Ferret;
“that’s just what he will do. He’ll
go out of the front door as if he owned
the house. In all likelihood I’ll be
over the way when he and you come
out, and then of course I’ll follow
him myself, but if I ain’t there, you
must do as I say. Follow him no
matter wherever he goes—and then
come to Scotland Yard and report.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about all this,”
stoutly returned Kate, shaking her
head. “Why can’t Mr. Fair be advised
at once? This is all wrong—and
strange.”</p>

<p>“But you see, miss,” quickly protested
Ferret, “Mr. Fair has private
reasons for not wishing us to trouble
the foreign gent, so he wouldn’t help
us to nab him. Funny, isn’t it? But
it often happens that we poor detectives
has to catch all sorts of gents
in spite of the very parties on whose
accounts we wants ’em. The aristocracy
has objections against appearing
in court even against their own
murderers. Now Mr. Fair does not
know this gent’s little game and so
he trusts him. We’ve got to do all
this business ourselves—and, I tell
you, it’s life and death. So, is it a
go? Will you be a sensible young
woman and not make a row, and
help me?”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Kate, convinced
by the fellow’s irresistibly frank air—and
moved by the comforting
thought that her consent to his plan
would at least get him out of the house—when
she would of course advise
Mr. Fair of the whole matter, even
if it did spoil a good dinner.</p>

<p>“That’s a real lady for you,”
gallantly remarked Ferret. “Now I’m
off. Come downstairs if you want
to see me out of the house—you
suspicious young thing. No? All
right. Thanks, but you really must
sit in that little room, you know, for
he may be leaving the house at any
minute.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get my hat first,” replied Kate,
“so that I can be ready to follow him
if he goes out.”</p>

<p>Ferret slid noiselessly out of the
library with a warning finger at his
lips, and Kate congratulated herself
upon having so cleverly deceived him.
She would hide the parcel containing
the surprise and then send word to
the dining-room that she must see
Mr. Fair at once.</p>

<p>She sat for a moment trying to think
out the impressions which had been
pouring in upon her in this hour
of cataclysm and departure. What
had brought the foreign gentleman
to the house? What had he done to
make him the subject of police suspicion?
And why should Mr. Fair
wish to protect him from the law?
And—oh, how the thought came
crushing back into her heart after
being dislodged by the detective’s
sudden appearance—of what crime
had Mr. Fair spoken? The temporary
calmness that the diversion had purchased
for her gave way now to all
the torment that had preceded it.
Springing up to carry out her resolution—action
being at all events less
dreadful than idle horror—she took
the parcel from the table, and going
hurriedly across the room, lifted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
lid of the old carved chest. She
dropped the parcel into it—and fell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Allyne had just elicited a laugh by
one of his characterizations of a certain
great personage, when the party
at dinner heard a shriek that brought
them all to their feet. Mr. and Mrs.
Fair dashed upstairs with who can
say what horror of expectancy in
their minds. They found the governess
lying beside the chest in the library.
Fair acted promptly.</p>

<p>He heard the others running up the
stairs, so as he raised Kate from the
floor he said to Mrs. Fair; “Sit on the
chest, Janet—never mind why—and
do not rise from it until I get them
all out of here. It is only Miss Mettleby,
the governess—she has fainted,”
he added as Mrs. March and Allyne
entered followed by Travers.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Mrs. Fair, how pale
you look—what has really happened?”
asked Mrs. March anxiously.</p>

<p>“Miss Mettleby has had a bad turn—that’s
all. Pray, all of you go,”
replied Fair, for Mrs. Fair, with a
white face and vacant look, sat as if
unconscious of what passed.</p>

<p>“Allyne, take Mrs. March down,
won’t you?” asked Travers, to relieve
the situation, and then, after Allyne
and Mrs. March were gone: “Is
there nothing that I can do, Fair?
My God, man, what does it all mean?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old chap,” answered Fair
as he laid Miss Mettleby upon the
leather lounge; “nothing. Go down
now, or Lady Poynter will fear there
is something serious the matter. Janet,
my love, let Travers see you down.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fair suffered Travers to lead
her away, walking in a trance.</p>

<p>“Kate—Kate,” said Fair, bending
over the governess and chafing her
hands which now began to twitch
convulsively.</p>

<p>“Has he gone?” asked Kate, opening
her eyes and staring nervously around
the room.</p>

<p>“There is nobody here, Miss Mettleby,”
quietly answered Fair, helping
her to her feet. “Are you better?”</p>

<p>“I must have fainted—how stupid
of me,” replied Miss Mettleby, getting
herself together and shuddering as
the reality came back upon her.
“It is nothing, Mr. Fair. Now please
go back to your dinner—oh, how
foolish and annoying of me to disturb
you all in this way! I will get
my hat and take the air for a few
minutes. Come.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly out of the
library, and in the passage Kate insisted
on his returning to the dining-room
while she ran up to her own
room.</p>

<p>Fair went down accordingly, tortured
with the fear that she had opened
the chest. Miss Mettleby, hastily
preparing for the street, slipped out
of the house and fled along to the
corner, where she took a cab and was
driven off at a mad pace.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>About nine o’clock that evening
Mr. Inspector Sharpe sat in his little
office, running his eye over the
records of a day’s departures from
the steep and thorny path on the
part of the very mixed and sorely
tried people of London. At that
hour he was on duty also on emergency
cases that might be reported
at the ever-expectant Yard.
So he glanced at his reports casually,
as one does who looks to be interrupted
at any moment. The bells in the
steeples were chiming nine when a
constable entered, conducting a very
agitated young woman who showed
not only the usual nervousness of
the layman in police offices, but also
a great deal of not very clearly defined
personal anxiety.</p>

<p>“Well? Well?” asked the Inspector,
without looking up from his reports.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—but is this—?”
asked a timid voice in return.</p>

<p>“Ah, a lady,” exclaimed the Inspector
on seeing her. “Beg pardon,
ma’am. Have a seat, ma’am. And
now what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Is this where they report things?”
asked the girl apologetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“Bless us all,” cried out Sharpe,
with a smile; “they report some
things here, miss. Who are you,
now?”</p>

<p>“Does it matter? Must I say who
I am?” inquired the lady anxiously.</p>

<p>“Really, you know, I can’t say as
to that, you know, miss,” replied the
Inspector, with a merriment which he
frowned at when the constable began
to join in it. “If you have something
to report, I must know who it is as
reports it, wouldn’t you say? But
there, now, miss, don’t you be afraid
of nothing. Out with it. What seems
to be a-troublin’ of such a quiet-looking
young person as you, miss?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the girl, much
encouraged by the humanity of the
terrible officer whose uniform and
surroundings appalled her at first, “I
just wanted to report that he did go
out and I followed him, but he walked
so fast that I couldn’t keep up with
him, and he disappeared around the
corner, please, sir.”</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” laughed the Inspector.
“You wouldn’t have no objection
to mentionin’ the gent’s name,
now, would you? Must have somebody’s
name.”</p>

<p>“Why, you know who I mean,”
answered the girl, with surprise, as it
did not of course occur to her that a
number of young women had been
asked to follow strange gentlemen
about the streets that very evening.
“You know who it was—the foreign
gentleman, you know.”</p>

<p>The Inspector burst into a hearty
laugh at this, but said sharply to
his subordinate: “Bellows, if you
laugh again, I’ll report you. No,
miss, I really can’t say as I do know
just who you mean. You see, we
has such a lot of foreign gents to look
after one way or another, that we
gets ’em sort o’ mixed like, sometimes,
you know. Who was your particular
foreign gent and why did he walk so
fast and why was you so keen to
catch ’im?”</p>

<p>“This is very strange,” replied the
girl, beginning to think that, after
all, she had been played upon by
that horrid, suave thief. “Mr. Ferret
told me to come here and tell you
all about it, you know. At Mr.
Maxwell Fair’s, you know—Carlton
House Terrace—please say you understand.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” exclaimed Sharpe, at
once showing the keenest interest and
bristling with alert readiness both to
hear and to act. “It’s Ferret, is it?
Bellows, go and ask Ferret to come
here.” The constable departed to do
as he was bid in spite of a gesture of
protest from Miss Mettleby and her
statement that Mr. Ferret was not
here but at Mr. Fair’s house.</p>

<p>“Now, miss,” began the Inspector,
when Bellows closed the door after him,
“how do you come to be interested
in this Spanish conspiracy? It was
Señor Mendes that you followed, eh?
Why? Speak out, now, plain and
square. It’s an ugly business for the
likes of you to get mixed up in.”</p>

<p>Miss Mettleby heard all this with a
rapidly deepening feeling of guilty
complicity in some dark plot, and yet,
beneath this sickening dread, she
felt a vague hope that now she would
glean some intelligent idea of the
mystery into which she, Mr. Fair—all
her world, had been so suddenly
plunged by the hurrying events of the
past two hours.</p>

<p>“Oh, you see, sir,” she began; “I
assure you that I know absolutely
nothing at all about what Mr. Ferret
was about—nothing. I am the governess
in Mr. Fair’s family, that’s all.
And this evening when the family
were at dinner Mr. Ferret came into
the library—nearly frightening me
to death—and told me that a foreign
gentleman was in our house who intended
some sort of mischief to my
kind employer. So he asked me to
watch the street door and to follow
the man if he should go out before
Mr. Ferret returned from telegraphing
or something. And, of course, the
whole thing is non——”</p>

<p>Her pitiful little plot to divert police
suspicion from her knight until the
horrible evidence of someone’s guilt—not
his, not his!—could be removed was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
nipped at this point by the entrance,
to her unspeakable surprise, of Ferret
himself, smiling and unruffled.</p>

<p>“Ferret, do you know this young
lady?” asked the inspector perfunctorily.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Ferret, with a
salute—military to his chief and cavalier
to the trembling Kate. “She’s the
governess, sir, at Mr. Maxwell Fair’s.
How are you again, miss? You are
here rather earlier than I looked for
you. She’s a regular corker, sir.”</p>

<p>“Silence!” snapped the Inspector,
to whom discipline was all. “This
young person was telling me that she
watched as you requested. Go on,
miss.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Ferret had scarcely gone
out when the foreign gentleman passed
out of the street door and I immediately
followed him,” went on poor Kate,
with oozing hope that her blundering
lie would be believed, now that that
gimlet-eyed Ferret was here to observe
her. “The man crossed the
square and walked quickly down the
next street.”</p>

<p>She stopped. Ferret seemed to be
whistling in mild but growing unbelief—conduct
which he suddenly
abandoned on receiving a wireless
message of caution from the Inspector.
The nimble mind of Ferret caught his
superior’s point at once, so he fell in
with his policy and said, as if to encourage
Kate to proceed bravely
with her transparent and useful lie:
“Didn’t I tell you he would do so?”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Ferret!” cried Sharpe,
fearing that Ferret would develop
some new indiscretion. “Go on, miss,
go on. You saw the gent turn the
corner?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Kate, with fresh
courage; “he turned the corner and
I ran after him. There were many
people in the narrow street into which
he had turned, but I kept him in view
and——”</p>

<p>“And you jumped into the next
cab as quick as a flash—” put in
Ferret, when he noticed that her powers
of creation were ebbing, “and followed
him until you saw him go into—go
on, go on, miss—you’re great, you
are.”</p>

<p>“Alas, no,” sighed Kate, fearing to
venture to be so specific as to locate
the mysterious man in a definite house
anywhere. “Alas, no. When I reached
Pall Mall he had disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dam—that is, you know, I beg
pardon—what a pity you missed him,”
exclaimed Ferret, rapidly calculating
what her game was.</p>

<p>“It is only just gone nine,” remarked
the Inspector sternly. “When
was it that you were at Mr. Fair’s
house, Ferret? This is very strange.”</p>

<p>It was Ferret’s turn now to fear
that the course of affairs reflected on
his discretion, and, while he could
hardly believe that the Inspector had
failed to perceive that the governess
was fibbing, he could not risk being
thought a bungler, for Sharpe was a
man of few words, quick action, and
little given to reopening cases once he
had decided them.</p>

<p>“I am afraid the young lady has
made a mistake,” Ferret continued
carefully. “It was dark and she probably
mistook somebody else for the
foreign gent. You see, sir, I changed
my mind and didn’t go to telephone,
but stood immediately opposite Mr.
Fair’s house until ten minutes ago, and
the gent had not come out of the door—that
I can swear to.”</p>

<p>Ferret hoped that this bit of information
would so shake the girl’s confidence
in her story that she would begin
a new and contradictory one.</p>

<p>“But he <i>did</i> go out,” sobbed Kate,
truly shaken, but with a woman’s determination
to see a thing through; “I
say he did go out. Oh, Mr. Inspector,
tell me that you believe me! There is
no foreign gentleman at Mr. Fair’s
house—so it will be very foolish for
you to send any of those awful detectives
there. Do, <i>do</i> believe me! I
tell you, sir, that there has been no
foreign gentleman at our house, and
anyway I saw him go out.”</p>

<p>“Ferret, come into my private
office a minute,” said Sharpe, trying to
retain his customary solemn and impressive
expression. “Please wait here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
for us, miss. Nobody will come in to
molest you.”</p>

<p>“My God, what have I done now?”
cried Kate, when the two terrible men,
with their cold, businesslike, lynx
ways, had gone. “But he did not do it—he
did NOT!” she moaned as she
leaned her poor reeling head upon the
edge of the Inspector’s desk.</p>

<p>They came back after a few minutes.</p>

<p>“We believe your story, miss,”
began the Inspector kindly; “and Ferret
will be severely reprimanded in the
morning for having annoyed you by
going into your house. Now tell me
anything more that you may know
about this silly rumor—but be careful
what you say, for you may have to
swear to the truth of it all in a court
of law. I shall take down what you
say. Come, now, what is your name?”</p>

<p>“Kate Mettleby,” she replied, with
uneasiness as she thought of perjury;
“but really, truly, honestly, there
has been no murder at our house, so I
don’t see why you should want me
to——”</p>

<p>“Of course not, of course not,” interrupted
the Inspector, with a cordiality
and candor that brought her
immense relief; “but, you see, the law
compels us to look sharp into the ways
of all foreigners. The law is that all
foreigners are guilty until they can
prove themselves innocent—which is
very seldom possible.”</p>

<p>Ferret made a little movement as if
he were going to protest against quite
such a bald bit of cruel treatment of an
innocent baby, but he remembered his
duty and held his tongue.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that the law?” asked Kate,
with wide eyes. “But surely there must
be some foreigners who are as good as
English people.”</p>

<p>“There may be,” admitted the Inspector
sorrowfully; “but the law don’t
believe it if it can help it. Now, Miss
Mettleby, governesses and servants
has opportunities. They sometimes
hear and see a good deal that is said
and done by the gentry. Mr. and Mrs.
Fair never quarrel, I suppose, about a
party by the name of Mendes, do they?”</p>

<p>The shrewd officer of the law regretted
his words as soon as he had
spoken them, for Kate sprang to her
feet, burning with shame and indignation.</p>

<p>“You mistake, sir!” she cried
fiercely. “I am not a servant, but
the friend of Mrs. Maxwell Fair. And
if I were a servant, do you suppose—I
despise your insulting innuendo!
And I tell you that Mr. Fair is utterly
incapable of the crime which I can see
that your bloodhound, Mr. Ferret
there, thinks he has committed. I am
going.”</p>

<p>“You are going in a moment—when
I allow you to do so,” returned
the Inspector, anxious to retrieve his
mistake, but also desirous to let her
understand that he had authority.
“Now don’t be foolish, miss. You
fly off into a rage quite unnecessarily, I
assure you. Mr. Ferret neither makes
nor implies any charge of any sort
against Mr. Fair, you know. Now be
calm and simply answer my questions—you
will have to answer them here or
in court, remember. You have heard
Mr. and Mrs. Fair speak of one Don
Pablo Mendes, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes—many times, but always with
kindness,” replied Kate stiffly.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Sharpe benignly.
“Now we are getting on. And this
Don Pablo Mendes has been at the
house frequently, has he not?”</p>

<p>“Never, as far as I know, until
today,” answered Kate, still far from
mollified. “Mrs. Fair has been—but,
no, I sha’n’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, don’t half say things in
that way, you know,” exclaimed the
Inspector, nettled. Then, coaxingly:
“You see, miss, when a witness says
half of a thing, the law compels
us to piece it out as we think best.
So out with it. Mrs. Fair has seen
Mendes somewhere away from home—you
were going to say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Kate, scarlet with
shame at the man’s seeming implication,
and not a little annoyed by his
almost supernatural ability to piece
out, as he put it, her half sentences;
“but, sir, I’d have you understand
that Mrs. Fair always consulted Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
Fair before meeting Mr. Mendes—always.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” answered Sharpe, with
a look of lofty elevation above her implied
rebuke. “Now, miss, don’t please
see more than is in my words. And
don’t be afraid either. Remember, it
is this Spanish gent, Mendes, and not
either your Mr. or Mrs. Fair, that we
are looking for.”</p>

<p>“Thank God for that,” murmured
Kate, beginning to break down visibly.</p>

<p>Sharpe, on a wink from Ferret,
waited a few seconds while Ferret
fetched a glass of water, which the
wretched girl drank eagerly—with a
poor little smile of thanks that made
the susceptible Ferret wish Mendes
had never been born. This diversion
greatly cleared the atmosphere at
once.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know who
Mendes is and why we want him?”
asked the Inspector finally, with the
air of a gossip rather than that of an
inquisitor, which had the effect he desired,
for Kate looked up fearlessly now.</p>

<p>“I have no idea,” she answered
promptly, glad to be able again to tell
the truth. Then, adding with the
former tone of apology to truth: “All
I ask is that you send nobody to our
house—now that Mr. Mendes has gone
away from it. You won’t, will you?
Please, please, do not!”</p>

<p>“It would be nonsense to look for
him when he’s gone, wouldn’t it?”
laughed Sharpe. “And you know we
never do nonsensical things when we
know it. That will do, I think, miss.
You may go, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” gasped Kate, with
alacrity. “And don’t you see that if
Mendes has committed some great
crime he would be very likely to commit
suicide? So I don’t see why you
should think that—now, don’t laugh.”</p>

<p>Her last words were addressed to
Ferret, who did not know that she had
an eye on him. When she closed the
door and they heard her pass into the
outer passage, it was with anything
but a smile that Ferret looked up at his
chief and said: “Well, by all that’s
holy—did you ever?”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p>Miss Mettleby took a cab and
was soon stretched upon her bed
more than ever torn and tortured
by the perfect vortex of vague conjecture
and too actual knowledge
which now dragged her and the man
she loved and her whole world down
to some indefinite but certain ruin.</p>

<p>In the meantime Inspector Sharpe
disposed of two cases that had just
been brought in, and then sending for
Ferret, the two penetrating, cool,
keen-scented gentlemen sat on opposite
sides of the little table in the
Inspector’s private office and discussed
the rapidly developing situation.</p>

<p>“But what the devil does it all
mean?” inquired Sharpe, showing by his
graver and tenser expression that the
case was passing from an ordinary
piece of blackmail, involving a few
unimportant foreigners, to a very
genuine mystery of much more serious
aspect, involving not an English gentleman
merely, but the particular
English gentleman who was at that
moment in the eye of the public.</p>

<p>“Mean? Mean?” answered Ferret,
leaning back with an air of immense
professional eagerness. “Why, man,
can’t you see what it means? In the
first place, something happened after
I left the house that changed the dear
little governess lady’s mind. She was
told to leave the house, to follow the
Cuban, you see. Well, the Cuban
didn’t go out as the little one so
prettily lied to you. I know this
because I had five of our trustiest
men watching every entrance to the
house. So, for some reason the girl
has joined Fair in his unaccountable
effort to keep the rum chap out of
our hands. There was a row of some
sort just after I left the house, for
Wilson, whom I let into the place, saw
them all suddenly rush up from the
dinner-table, but, as they came back
presently, Wilson didn’t go up to the
library—especially as he saw pretty
Kate slip out into the street. Getting
thickish, eh? Well, sir, the shot that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
we heard about seven o’clock was
fired in Fair’s house, for I saw his
revolver lying on the library-table with
one chamber empty. How’s that for
your little game?”</p>

<p>“This is getting interesting,” muttered
the Inspector.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just?” answered Ferret,
sitting up triumphantly. “And what
did I tell you? I knew there was a
deal more than just an innocent bit
of Mendes’s regular little practice.
The papers will be worth reading, sir,
tomorrow or the day after. I wish
this governess, though, was out of it.”</p>

<p>“You have the house well watched?”
asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>“Rather,” answered Ferret, with
one of his expressive winks. “Wilson
and Banks and Thorpe and two others.
They won’t let very much get through
their fingers. Another thing. The
Fairs are closing the house tomorrow
morning all of a sudden. All the servants
have been notified. Fair himself
will spend the day at Drayton Hall—you
know, old Sir Nelson Poynter’s
place in Surrey—and the missis and
the kids will go to Paris. I quietly
read the two telegrams that Fair sent
off to engage the rooms for them in
Paris. Wilson will follow them, while
Thorpe will run down to Drayton Hall
tonight to see how things lie. Tomorrow
after they have gone I shall
give the house a thorough looking
over, I can promise you. Sharpe, my
lad, we’ve struck a gold mine!”</p>

<p>“But what do you make of it all?”
asked Sharpe. “I confess that I’m in
the dark. Have you got at the real
situation?”</p>

<p>“Walls have ears—and even minor
police officials have a liking for knowing
what their superiors are at—so,
your ear,” replied Ferret, going to the
Inspector’s side and whispering to
him.</p>

<p>“Lord! You don’t mean that?” exclaimed
Sharpe, jumping up.</p>

<p>“How’s that for a bit of sensation
for the newspapers? Maxwell Fair—Phew!”</p>

<p>“But how ever did you come to
talk to the young lady at the house?
Was that quite prudent, do you think?
Isn’t she a bit skittish?” asked the
Inspector when he resumed his seat.
“Poor little innocent!—what a fool
she was to come here and tell us that
he didn’t do it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the governess—ain’t she a
circus?” laughed Ferret. “What a
deep one to come and tell us not to
send any horrid detectives! You see,
she was in the library when I went up
there during their dinner to have a
look round for the cause of the shooting,
and, incidentally, for the Cuban,
though I knew he must be higher up
in the house somewhere—attic probably.
I had to get the blooming girlie
out of the library, so I opened up
my little plan about having her watch
for the Cuban, and she took to it like
a trout after a fly. That was before
whatever happened a little while
afterward which opened her eyes
and changed her bearings. When I
went out of the house I let Wilson into
it, to be ready to investigate the
library when pretty Kate came down
to watch the door—but the row that
sent them all hurrying from the dinner-table
altered that. I stood just over
the way under a tree, when out comes
my little lady, not following the Cuban,
for he hadn’t come out of the house,
but all by her lone and all of a blue
funk. She hops into a cab at the
corner and I into the next one—and
she got here half a minute ahead of
me. Glory what luck we’re playing
to; why, it’s better than——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the telephone
bell. The Inspector answered
it: “Well? Who? Yes. Yes. Ferret
is here—with me in my office. What?
No? Wait—Ferret will speak to you.
Good. All right.”</p>

<p>Sharpe turned to Ferret: “Here,
Ferret, it’s Wilson—says something’s
up. Better get it yourself.”</p>

<p>Ferret grabbed the instrument
eagerly. The case was developing a
trifle too rapidly. What could Wilson,
whom he had left under the stairs at
Mr. Fair’s, want so soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> Wall Street firm was engaged
in doing business as curb brokers and “washing”
a certain stock.</p>

<p>Do you know exactly what “washing”
stock is? It is simply a fake auction on a big
scale. It is the kind of thing that puts a
little man in jail if he is caught doing it.
It is the kind of thing that makes respectable
fortunes for some of the big men.</p>

<p>This firm was engaged in “washing” a
certain copper stock. An officer of the dignified
National City Bank was interested in
this stock. He had agreed to take a certain
amount of it at a very low price, and he
wanted to unload it on the public at a very
much higher price.</p>

<p>The brokers proceeded to “wash” the
stock accordingly.</p>

<p>Let us say that the stock was worth
fifty cents per share. One broker bid
fifty-five cents for a thousand shares,
and they all pretended that it was a legitimate
transaction—in reality it was a fake
bid and a fake transaction.</p>

<p>The other broker engaged in the skin
game would then bid sixty cents for another
thousand shares—and so it would go.</p>

<p>Not one person engaged in the swindle
was actually buying a single share of stock.
They simply bid back and forth, pretending
to buy it, and putting the price up day by
day.</p>

<p>The crowd of poor fools that believe
in the “honor” of these disreputable
Wall Street gamblers looked on at this mock
auction, this fake selling and buying of
stocks, amazed and excited by the constantly
increasing values.</p>

<p>Occasionally some gullible creature outside
the combination that was doing the
stock “washing” would come in and in good
faith buy some shares, actually paying his
good money for the worthless stuff.</p>

<p>This went on until they had forced the
price of the stock up to a high figure, ten
times what it was worth. During this
“washing” operation, they had succeeded
in working off a good deal of this stock on
the public that believed the crooked sales
were really genuine.—<i>New York Journal.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers will remember the article
we printed a short time ago by Mr. Eltweed
Pomeroy, showing how the voters
of one ward of the city of Los Angeles,
Cal., “recalled” an alderman charged
with corruption. That was the first time
in the United States the Recall has been
used. About six weeks ago San Diego
voted to amend its constitution by adopting
the Initiative, Referendum and the
Recall, and the Legislature has just ratified
this. We understand that Pasadena
has also just adopted the Recall, though it
has had the Initiative and Referendum
for about a year. Thus government by
the people extends itself. The evils of
democracy can best be cured by more
democracy.—<i>Independent (N. Y.).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reports</span> of suffering from poverty in
London are harrowing. At a relief meeting
on the 31st it was reported that 200,000
people in that city alone are living on the
verge of starvation. In the midst of all
this suffering there is something shocking,
in spite of the evident good intentions of
those in attendance, about the self-satisfaction
of the luxurious persons constituting
the relief meeting at which this report was
made. The meeting was held in the house
of a duke, whose great income flows unearned
into his private coffers from the common
inheritance of all Londoners. A
duchess, whose family lives in luxury on
incomes also wrung unearned from people
who work, occupied the chair. Among
those participating were other titled personages
whose luxurious incomes are enjoyed
at the expense of their starving fellows
whose sufferings they had assembled
to relieve. But all they proposed to do was
to spend pennies here and there for sweet
charity. Sweet charity! Yes, sweet; so
sweet to those who dole it out, and so bitter
to those who must humbly take it or starve.
Not one word escaped the lips of any of this
charitable assemblage in recognition of the
element of justice. To know that 200,000
fellow men and women were on the verge of
starvation excited their human sympathies;
but that the starving horde were
starving because privileged drones and
titled parasites revel in unearned incomes,
clearly manifest as is the relation here of
cause and effect, did not concern the relief
meeting. It was something like this that
Tolstoy had in mind when with characteristic
simplicity and directness he said: “The
rich are willing to do anything for the poor
people but get off their backs.”—<i>Chicago

<p>The last echo of his heroic brays has
died away.</p>

<p>His tail lies limp on the bare ground, like

<i>San Francisco Examiner</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> “Mr. Hastings has touched the very core of
the matter respecting the proclivities of our doddering plutocracy.
Throughout his book he has revealed that plutocracy in its true light
and shown it to be something utterly conscienceless and debased. No
more scathing review of the situation, as it is seen at present, could
possibly be given in a work of fiction.”</p>

<p class="blockquot">Will the United States be a monarchy in 1975? Have you read
“THE FIRST AMERICAN KING,” by George Gordon Hastings?
It is a dashing romance in which a scientist and a detective of today
wake up seventy-five years later to find His Majesty, Imperial and
Royal, William I, Emperor of the United States and King of the
Empire State of New York, ruling the land, with the real power in the
hands of half a dozen huge trusts. Automobiles have been replaced
by phaërmobiles; air-ships sail above the surface of the earth; there
has been a successful war against Russia; a social revolution is brewing.
The book is both an enthralling romance and a serious sociological
study, which scourges unmercifully the society and politics of the
present time, many of whose brightest stars reappear in the future
under thinly disguised names. There are wit and humor and sarcasm
galore—a stirring tale of adventure and a charming love-story.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
